Too far did I fly into the future: a horror seized upon me.

And when I looked around me, behold, there time was my sole contemporary.

Then did I fly backwards, homewards- and always faster. Thus did I come to you: you present-day men, and into the land of culture.

For the first time brought I an eye to see you, and good desire: verily, with longing in my heart did I come.

But how did it turn out with me? Although so alarmed- I had yet to laugh! Never did my eye see anything so motley-colored!

I laughed and laughed, while my foot still trembled, and my heart as well. "Here , is the home of all the paint-pots,"- said I.

With fifty patches painted on faces and limbs- so sat you there to my astonishment, you present-day men!

And with fifty mirrors around you, which flattered your play of colors, and repeated it!

You could wear no better masks, you present-day men, than your own faces! Who could- recognize you!

Written all over with the characters of the past, and these characters also pencilled over with new characters- thus have you concealed yourselves well from all decipherers!

And though one be a trier of the reins, who still believes that you have reins! Out of colors you seem to be baked, and out of glued scraps.

All times and peoples gaze divers-colored out of your veils; all customs and beliefs speak divers-colored out of your gestures.

He who would strip you of veils and wrappers, and paints and gestures, would just have enough left to scare the crows.

I myself am the scared crow that once saw you naked, and without paint; and I flew away when the skeleton ogled at me.

Rather would I be a day-laborer in the under-world, and among the shades of the by-gone!- Fatter and fuller than you, are the underworldlings!

This, yes this, is bitterness to my bowels, that I can neither endure you naked nor clothed, you present-day men!

All that is unhomelike in the future, and whatever makes strayed birds shiver, is verily more homelike and familiar than your "reality."

For thus speak you: "Real are we wholly, and without faith and superstition": thus do you plume yourselves- alas! even without plumes!

Indeed, how would you be able to believe, you divers-colored ones!you who are pictures of all that has ever been believed!

Perambulating refutations are you, of belief itself, and a dislocation of all thought. Untrustworthy ones: thus do I call you, you real ones!

All periods prate against one another in your spirits; and the dreams and pratings of all periods were even realer than your awakeness!

Unfruitful are you: therefore do you lack belief. But he who had to create, had always his presaging dreams and astral premonitions- and believed in believing!-

Half-open doors are you, at which grave-diggers wait. And this is your reality: "Everything deserves to perish."

Alas, how you stand there before me, you unfruitful ones; how lean your ribs! And many of you surely have had knowledge thereof.

Many a one has said: "There has surely a God filched something from me secretly whilst I slept? enough to make a girl for himself therefrom!

"Amazing is the poverty of my ribs!" thus has spoken many a present-day man.

Yes, you are laughable to me, you present-day men! And especially when you marvel at yourselves!

And woe to me if I could not laugh at your marvelling, and had to swallow all that is repugnant in your platters!

As it is, however, I will make lighter of you, since I have to carry what is heavy; and what matter if beetles and May-bugs also alight on my load!

It shall not on that account become heavier to me! And not from you, you present-day men, shall my great weariness arise.-

Ah, where shall I now ascend with my longing! From all mountains do I look out for fatherlands and motherlands.

But a home have I found nowhere: unsettled am I in all cities, and decamping at all gates.

Alien to me, and a mockery, are the present-day men, to whom of late my heart impelled me; and exiled am I from fatherlands and motherlands.

Thus do I love only my children's land, the undiscovered in the remotest sea: for it do I bid my sails search and search.

To my children will I make amends for being the child of my fathers: and to all the future- for this present-day!-

Thus spoke Zarathustra.
