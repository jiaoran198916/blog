We do not want to be spared by our best enemies, nor by those whom we love from the very heart. So let me tell you the truth!
<!-- more -->
My brothers in war! I love you from the very heart. I am, and was always, your counterpart. And I am also your best enemy. So let me tell you the truth!

I know the hatred and envy of your hearts. You are not great enough not to know hatred and envy. Then be great enough not to be ashamed of them!

And if you cannot be saints of knowledge, then, I pray you, be at least its warriors. They are the companions and precursors of such saints.

I see many soldiers; If only I saw many warriors! "Uniform" one calls what they wear; if only what it covers were not uniform!

You shall be those whose eyes always seek for an enemy- for your enemy. And some of you hate at first sight.

You shall seek your enemy; you shall wage your war- for your thoughts! And if your thoughts perish, your honesty should still shout triumph for that!

You shall love peace as a means to new wars- and the short peace more than the long.

I recommend to you not work, but battle. I recommend to you not peace, but victory. Let your work be a battle, let your peace be a victory!

One can only be silent and sit peacefully when one has arrow and bow; otherwise one chatters and quarrels. Let your peace be a victory!

You say it is the good cause which hallows even war? I say to you: it is the good war which hallows every cause.

War and courage have done more great things than charity. Not your sympathy, but your bravery has before now saved the unfortunate.

"What is good?" you ask. To be brave is good. Let the little girls say: "The good is that which is both pretty and touching."

They call you heartless: but your heart is true, and I love that you are ashamed to show it. You are ashamed of your flood, while others are ashamed of their ebb.

You are ugly? Well then, my brothers, wrap the sublime about you, the cloak of the ugly!

And when your soul becomes great, then it becomes mischievous, and in your sublimity there is mockery. I know you.

In mockery the mischievous man and the weakling meet. But they misunderstand each other. I know you.

You shall only have enemies you can hate, not enemies you despise. You must be proud of your enemy; then, the success of your enemy is also your success.

Disobedience- that is the nobility of slaves. Let your nobility be obedience. Let your commanding itself be an obeying!

To the good warrior "thou shalt" sounds better than "I will." And all that is dear to you, you shall first have it commanded of you.

Let your love of life be love of your highest hope; and let your highest hope be the highest thought of life!

Your highest thought, however, you shall receive as a command from me- and it is this: man is something that will be overcome.

So live your life of obedience and of war! What matters long life! What warrior wishes to be spared!

I do not spare you, I love you from my very heart, my brothers in war!-

Thus spoke Zarathustra.
