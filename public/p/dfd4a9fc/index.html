        <p>YOU DO not want to kill, you judges and executioners, until the animal has bowed its head? Behold, the pale criminal has bowed his head: out of his eye speaks the great contempt.</p>
<p>“My ego is something that shall be overcome: my ego is to me the great contempt of man”: so speaks it out of that eye.</p>
<p>When he judged himself- that was his supreme moment; let not the exalted one return again to his baseness!</p>
<p>There is no salvation for the man who thus suffers from himself, unless it be speedy death.</p>
<p>Your killing, you judges, shall be pity, and not revenge; and as you kill, be sure that you yourselves affirm life!</p>
<p>It is not enough that you should reconcile with the man whom you kill. Let your sorrow be love of the Superman: thus you will justify your own survival!</p>
<p>“Enemy” you shall say, but not “villain,” “invalid” you shall say, but not “wretch,” “fool” you shall say, but not “sinner.”</p>
<p>And you, red judge, if you would confess to all you have done in thought, then everyone would cry: “Away with this filth and this poisonous snake!”</p>
<p>But the thought is one thing, the deed another, and the idea of the deed still another. The wheel of causality does not roll between them.</p>
<p>An idea made this pale man pale. He was equal to his deed when he did it, but the idea of it, he could not endure when it was done.</p>
<p>Always he now saw himself as the doer of one deed. Madness, I call this: the exception reversed itself to the rule in him.</p>
<p>The streak of chalk bewitches the hen; the stroke he struck stopped his weak reason. Madness after the deed, I call this.</p>
<p>34 Hearken, you judges! There is another madness besides, and it is before the deed. Ah! you have not yet crept deep enough into this soul!</p>
<p>Thus speaks the red judge: “Why did this criminal commit murder? He meant to rob.” I tell you, however, that his soul wanted blood, not robbery: he thirsted for the bliss of the knife!</p>
<p>But his weak reason did not understand this madness, and it persuaded him: “What matters blood!” it said; “don’t you want, at least, to rob? Or take revenge?”</p>
<p>And he listened to his weak reason: like lead its words laid upon himtherefore he robbed when he murdered. He did not want to be ashamed of his madness.</p>
<p>And now the lead of his guilt lies upon him, and once more his weak reason is so numb, so paralyzed, so dull.</p>
<p>If only he could only shake his head, then his burden would roll off; but who can shake that head?</p>
<p>What is this man? A mass of diseases that reach out into the world through his spirit; there they want to catch their prey.</p>
<p>What is this man? A coil of wild snakes that are seldom at peace among themselves- so they go forth separately and seek their prey in the world.</p>
<p>Look at that poor body! What it suffered and craved, the poor soul interpreted to itself- it interpreted it as murderous desire, and eagerness for the bliss of the knife.</p>
<p>The man who turns sick today, is overcome by the evil which is evil today: he seeks to cause pain with whatever causes him pain. But there have been other ages, and another evil and good.</p>
<p>Once doubt was evil, and the will to Self. Then the invalids became heretics or witches; as heretics or witches they suffered, and sought to cause suffering.</p>
<p>But this will not enter your ears; it hurts your good people, you tell me. But what matter your good people to me!</p>
<p>Much about your good people cause me disgust, and verily, not their evil. I wish that they had a madness by which they might perish, like this pale criminal!</p>
<p>I wish that their madness were called truth, or fidelity, or justice: but they have their virtue in order to live long, and in miserable selfcomplacency.</p>
<p>35 I am a railing beside the torrent; whoever is able to grasp me may grasp me! Your crutch, however, I am not.-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>
