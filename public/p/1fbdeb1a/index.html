        <p>1.</p>
<p>Here do I sit and wait, old broken law-tablets around me and also new half-written law-tablets. When comes my hour?</p>
<p>-The hour of my descent, of my down-going: for once more will I go to men.</p>
<p>For that hour do I now wait: for first must the signs come to me that it is my hour- namely, the laughing lion with the flock of doves.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Meanwhile do I talk to myself as one who has time. No one tells me anything new, so I tell myself my own story.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>When I came to men, then found I them resting on an old infatuation: all of them thought they had long known what was good and bad for men.</p>
<p>An old wearisome business seemed to them all talk of virtue; and he who wished to sleep well spoke of “good” and “bad” before retiring to rest.</p>
<p>This somnolence did I disturb when I taught that no one yet knows what is good and bad:- unless it be the creator!</p>
<p>-It is he, however, who creates man’s goal, and gives to the earth its meaning and its future: he only effects it that anything is good or bad.</p>
<p>And I bade them upset their old academic chairs, and wherever that old infatuation had sat; I bade them laugh at their great moralists, their saints, their poets, and their saviours.</p>
<p>At their gloomy sages did I bid them laugh, and whoever had sat admonishing as a black scarecrow on the tree of life.</p>
<p>On their great grave-highway did I seat myself, and even beside the carrion and vultures- and I laughed at all their bygone and its mellow decaying glory.</p>
<p>Like penitential preachers and fools did I cry wrath and shame on all their greatness and smallness. Oh, that their best is so very small! Oh, that their worst is so very small! Thus did I laugh.</p>
<p>Thus did my wise longing, born in the mountains, cry and laugh in me; a wild wisdom, verily!- my great pinion-rustling longing.</p>
<p>And oft did it carry me off and up and away and in the midst of laughter; then flew I quivering like an arrow with sun-intoxicated rapture:</p>
<p>-Out into distant futures, which no dream has yet seen, into warmer souths than ever sculptor conceived,- where gods in their dancing are ashamed of all clothes:</p>
<p>(That I may speak in parables and halt and stammer like the poets: and verily I am ashamed that I have still to be a poet!)</p>
<p>Where all becoming seemed to me dancing of gods, and wantoning of gods, and the world unloosed and unbridled and fleeing back to itself:-</p>
<p>-As an eternal self-fleeing and re-seeking of one another of many gods, as the blessed self-contradicting, recommuning, and refraternising with one another of many gods:-</p>
<p>Where all time seemed to me a blessed mockery of moments, where necessity was freedom itself, which played happily with the goad of freedom:-</p>
<p>Where I also found again my old devil and arch-enemy, the spirit of gravity, and all that it created: constraint, law, necessity and consequence and purpose and will and good and evil:-</p>
<p>For must there not be that which is danced over, danced beyond? Must there not, for the sake of the nimble, the nimblest,- be moles and clumsy dwarfs?-</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>There was it also where I picked up from the path the word “Superman,” and that man is something that must be overcome.</p>
<p>-That man is a bridge and not a goal- rejoicing over his noontides and evenings, as advances to new rosy dawns:</p>
<p>-The Zarathustra word of the great noontide, and whatever else I have hung up over men like purple evening-afterglows.</p>
<p>Also new stars did I make them see, along with new nights; and over cloud and day and night, did I spread out laughter like a gay-colored canopy.</p>
<p>I taught them all my poetisation and aspiration: to compose and collect into unity what is fragment in man, and riddle and fearful chance;-</p>
<p>-As composer, riddle-reader, and redeemer of chance, did I teach them to create the future, and all that has been- to redeem by creating.</p>
<p>The past of man to redeem, and every “It was” to transform, until the Will says: “But so did I will it! So shall I will it-“</p>
<p>-This did I call redemption; this alone taught I them to call redemption.- Now do I await my redemption- that I may go to them for the last time.</p>
<p>For once more will I go to men: amongst them will my sun set; in dying will I give them my choicest gift!</p>
<p>From the sun did I learn this, when it goes down, the exuberant one: gold does it then pour into the sea, out of inexhaustible riches,-</p>
<p>-So that the poorest fisherman rows even with golden oars! For this did I once see, and did not tire of weeping in beholding it.- Like the sun will also Zarathustra go down: now sits he here and waits, old broken law-tablets around him, and also new law-tablets- halfwritten.</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Behold, here is a new table; but where are my brothers who will carry it with me to the valley and into hearts of flesh?-</p>
<p>Thus demands my great love to the remotest ones: be not considerate of your neighbor! Man is something that must be overcome.</p>
<p>There are many divers ways and modes of overcoming: see you thereto! But only a fool thinks: “man can also be overleapt.”</p>
<p>Overcome yourself even in your neighbor: and a right which you can seize upon, shall you not allow to be given you!</p>
<p>What you do can no one do to you again. Lo, there is no requital.</p>
<p>He who cannot command himself shall obey. And many a one can command himself, but still sorely lacks self-obedience!</p>
<p>5.</p>
<p>Thus wishes the type of noble souls: they desire to have nothing gratuitously, least of all, life.</p>
<p>He who is of the rabble wishes to live gratuitously; we others, however, to whom life has given itself- we are ever considering what we can best give in return!</p>
<p>And verily, it is a noble dictum which says: “What life promises us, that promise will we keep- to life!”</p>
<p>One should not wish to enjoy where one does not contribute to the enjoyment. And one should not wish to enjoy!</p>
<p>For enjoyment and innocence are the most bashful things. Neither like to be sought for. One should have them,- but one should rather seek for guilt and pain!-</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p>O my brothers, he who is a firstling is ever sacrificed. Now, however, are we firstlings!</p>
<p>We all bleed on secret sacrificial altars, we all burn and broil in honor of ancient idols.</p>
<p>Our best is still young: this excites old palates. Our flesh is tender, our skin is only lambs’ skin:- how could we not excite old idol-priests!</p>
<p>In ourselves dwells he still, the old idol-priest, who broils our best for his banquet. Ah, my brothers, how could firstlings fail to be sacrifices!</p>
<p>But so wishes our type; and I love those who do not wish to preserve themselves, the down-going ones do I love with my entire love: for they go beyond.-</p>
<p>7.</p>
<p>To be true- that can few be! And he who can, will not! Least of all, however, can the good be true.</p>
<p>Oh, those good ones! Good men never speak the truth. For the spirit, thus to be good, is a malady.</p>
<p>They yield, those good ones, they submit themselves; their heart repeats, their soul obeys: yet he who obeys, does not listen to himself!</p>
<p>All that is called evil by the good, must come together in order that one truth may be born. O my brothers, are you also evil enough for this truth?</p>
<p>The daring venture, the prolonged distrust, the cruel No, the tedium, the cutting-into-the-quick- how seldom do these come together! Out of such seed, however- is truth produced!</p>
<p>Beside the bad conscience has hitherto grown all knowledge! Break up, break up, you discerning ones, the old law-tablets!</p>
<p>8.</p>
<p>When the water has planks, when gangways and railings o’erspan the stream, verily, he is not believed who then says: “All is in flux.”</p>
<p>But even the simpletons contradict him. “What?” say the simpletons, “all in flux? Planks and railings are still over the stream!</p>
<p>“Over the stream all is stable, all the values of things, the bridges and bearings, all ‘good’ and ‘evil’: these are all stable!”-</p>
<p>Comes, however, the hard winter, the stream-tamer, then learn even the wittiest distrust, and verily, not only the simpletons then say: “Should not everything- stand still?”</p>
<p>“Fundamentally stands everything still”- that is an appropriate winter doctrine, good cheer for an unproductive period, a great comfort for winter-sleepers and fireside-loungers.</p>
<p>“Fundamentally stands everything still”-: but contrary thereto, preaches the thawing wind!</p>
<p>The thawing wind, a bullock, which is no ploughing bullock- a furious bullock, a destroyer, which with angry horns breaks the ice! The ice however- - breaks gangways!</p>
<p>O my brothers, is not everything at present in flux? Have not all railings and gangways fallen into the water? Who would still hold on to “good” and “evil”?</p>
<p>“Woe to us! Hail to us! The thawing wind blows!”- Thus preach, my brothers, through all the streets!</p>
<p>9.</p>
<p>There is an old illusion- it is called good and evil. Around soothsayers and astrologers has hitherto revolved the orbit of this illusion.</p>
<p>Once did one believe in soothsayers and astrologers; and therefore did one believe, “Everything is fate: you shall, for you must!”</p>
<p>Then again did one distrust all soothsayers and astrologers; and therefore did one believe, “Everything is freedom: you can, for you will!”</p>
<p>O my brothers, concerning the stars and the future there has hitherto been only illusion, and not knowledge; and therefore concerning good and evil there has hitherto been only illusion and not knowledge!</p>
<p>10.</p>
<p>“You shall not rob! you shall not kill!”- such precepts were once called sacred; before them did one bow the knee and the head, and take off one’s shoes.</p>
<p>But I ask you: Where have there ever been better robbers and killers in the world than such sacred precepts?</p>
<p>Is there not even in all life- robbing and killing? And for such precepts to be called sacred, was not truth itself thereby- slain?</p>
<p>-Or was it a sermon of death that called sacred what contradicted and dissuaded from life?- O my brothers, break up, break up for me the old law-tablets!</p>
<p>11.</p>
<p>It is my sympathy with all the past that I see it is abandoned,-</p>
<p>-Abandoned to the favor, the spirit and the madness of every generation that comes, and reinterprets all that has been as its bridge!</p>
<p>A great potentate might arise, an artful prodigy, who with approval and disapproval could strain and constrain all the past, until it became for him a bridge, a harbinger, a herald, and a cock-crowing.</p>
<p>This however is the other danger, and my other sympathy:- he who is of the rabble, his thoughts go back to his grandfather,- with his grandfather, however, does time cease.</p>
<p>Thus is all the past abandoned: for it might some day happen for the rabble to become master, and drown all time in shallow waters.</p>
<p>Therefore, O my brothers, a new nobility is needed, which shall be the adversary of all rabble and potentate rule, and shall inscribe anew the word “noble” on new law-tablets.</p>
<p>For many noble ones are needed, and many kinds of noble ones, for a new nobility! Or, as I once said in parable: “That is just divinity, that there are gods, but no God!”</p>
<p>12.</p>
<p>O my brothers, I consecrate you and point you to a new nobility: you shall become procreators and cultivators and sowers of the future;-</p>
<p>-not to a nobility which you could purchase like traders with traders’ gold; for little worth is all that has its price.</p>
<p>Let it not be your honor henceforth whence you come, but where you go! Your Will and your feet which seek to overcome you- let these be your new honor!</p>
<p>Not that you have served a prince- of what account are princes now!nor that you have become a bulwark to that which stands, that it may stand more firmly.</p>
<p>Not that your family have become courtly at courts, and that you have learned- gay-colored, like the flamingo- to stand long hours in shallow pools:</p>
<p>(For ability-to-stand is a merit in courtiers; and all courtiers believe that to blessedness after death pertains- permission-to-sit!)</p>
<p>Nor even that a Spirit called Holy, led your forefathers into promised lands, which I do not praise: for where the worst of all trees grew- the cross,- in that land there is nothing to praise!-</p>
<p>-And verily, wherever this “Holy Spirit” led its knights, always in such campaigns did- goats and geese, and wry-heads and guy-heads run foremost!-</p>
<p>O my brothers, not backward shall your nobility gaze, but outward! Exiles shall you be from all fatherlands and forefather-lands!</p>
<p>Your children’s land shall you love: let this love be your new nobility,the undiscovered in the remotest seas! For it do I bid your sails search and search!</p>
<p>To your children shall you make amends for being the children of your fathers: all the past shall you thus redeem! This new table do I place over you!</p>
<p>13.</p>
<p>“Why should one live? All is vain! To live- that is to thresh straw; to livethat is to burn oneself and yet not get warm.-</p>
<p>Such ancient babbling still passes for “wisdom”; because it is old, however, and smells mustily, therefore is it the more honored. Even mould ennobles.-</p>
<p>Children might thus speak: they shun the fire because it has burnt them! There is much childishness in the old books of wisdom.</p>
<p>And he who ever “threshes straw,” why should he be allowed to rail at threshing! Such a fool one would have to muzzle!</p>
<p>Such persons sit down to the table and bring nothing with them, not even good hunger:- and then do they rail: “All is vain!”</p>
<p>But to eat and drink well, my brothers, is verily no vain art! Break up, break up for me the law-tablets of the never-joyous ones!</p>
<p>14.</p>
<p>“To the clean are all things clean”- thus say the people. I, however, say to you: To the swine all things become swinish!</p>
<p>Therefore preach the visionaries and bowed-heads (whose hearts are also bowed down): “The world itself is a filthy monster.”</p>
<p>For these are all unclean spirits; especially those, however, who have no peace or rest, unless they see the world from the backside- the afterworldly!</p>
<p>To those do I say it to the face, although it sound unpleasantly: the world resembles man, in that it has a backside,- so much is true!</p>
<p>There is in the world much filth: so much is true! But the world itself is not therefore a filthy monster!</p>
<p>There is wisdom in the fact that much in the world smells badly: loathing itself creates wings, and fountain-divining powers!</p>
<p>In the best there is still something to loathe; and the best is still something that must be overcome!-</p>
<p>O my brothers, there is much wisdom in the fact that much filth is in the world!-</p>
<p>15.</p>
<p>Such sayings did I hear pious afterworldly speak to their consciences, and verily without wickedness or guile,- although there is nothing more guileful in the world, or more wicked.</p>
<p>“Let the world be as it is! Raise not a finger against it!”</p>
<p>“Let whoever will choke and stab and skin and scrape the people: raise not a finger against it! Thereby will they learn to renounce the world.”</p>
<p>“And your own reason- this shall you yourself stifle and choke; for it is a reason of this world,- thereby will you learn yourself to renounce the world.”-</p>
<p>-Shatter, shatter, O my brothers, those old law-tablets of the pious! Tatter the maxims of the world-maligners!-</p>
<p>16.</p>
<p>“He who learns much unlearns all violent cravings”- that do people now whisper to one another in all the dark lanes.</p>
<p>“Wisdom wearies, nothing is worth while; you shall not crave!”- this new table found I hanging even in the public markets.</p>
<p>Break up for me, O my brothers, break up also that new table! The weary-o’-the-world put it up, and the preachers of death and the jailer: for lo, it is also a sermon for slavery:-</p>
<p>Because they learned badly and not the best, and everything too early and everything too fast; because they ate badly: from thence has resulted their ruined stomach;-</p>
<p>-For a ruined stomach, is their spirit: it persuades to death! For verily, my brothers, the spirit is a stomach!</p>
<p>Life is a well of delight, but to him in whom the ruined stomach speaks, the father of affliction, all fountains are poisoned.</p>
<p>To discern: that is delight to the lion-willed! But he who has become weary, is himself merely “willed”; with him play all the waves.</p>
<p>And such is always the nature of weak men: they lose themselves on their way. And at last asks their weariness: “Why did we ever go on the way? All is indifferent!”</p>
<p>To them sounds it pleasant to have preached in their ears: “Nothing is worth while! You shall not will!” That, however, is a sermon for slavery.</p>
<p>O my brothers, a fresh blustering wind comes Zarathustra to all wayweary ones; many noses will he yet make sneeze!</p>
<p>Even through walls blows my free breath, and into prisons and imprisoned spirits!</p>
<p>Willing emancipates: for willing is creating: so do I teach. And only for creating shall you learn!</p>
<p>And also the learning shall you learn only from me, the learning well!He who has ears let him hear!</p>
<p>17.</p>
<p>There stands the boat- there goes it over, perhaps into vast nothingnessbut who wills to enter into this “Perhaps”?</p>
<p>None of you want to enter into the death-boat! How should you then be world-weary ones!</p>
<p>World-weary ones! And have not even withdrawn from the earth! Eager did I ever find you for the earth, amorous still of your own earthweariness!</p>
<p>Not in vain does your lip hang down:- a small worldly wish still sits on it! And in your eye- floats there not a little cloud of unforgotten earthly bliss?</p>
<p>There are on the earth many good inventions, some useful, some pleasant: for their sake is the earth to be loved.</p>
<p>And many such good inventions are there, that they are like woman’s breasts: useful at the same time, and pleasant.</p>
<p>You world-weary ones, however! You earth-idlers! You, shall one beat with stripes! With stripes shall one again make you sprightly limbs.</p>
<p>For if you be not invalids, or decrepit creatures, of whom the earth is weary, then are you sly sloths, or dainty, sneaking pleasure-cats. And if you will not again run gaily, then shall you- pass away!</p>
<p>To the incurable shall one not seek to be a physician: thus teaches Zarathustra:- so shall you pass away!</p>
<p>But more courage is needed to make an end than to make a new verse: that do all physicians and poets know well.-</p>
<p>18.</p>
<p>O my brothers, there are law-tablets which weariness framed, and lawtablets which slothfulness framed, corrupt slothfulness: although they speak similarly, they want to be heard differently.-</p>
<p>See this languishing one! Only a span-breadth is he from his goal; but from weariness has he lain down obstinately in the dust, this brave one!</p>
<p>From weariness yawns he at the path, at the earth, at the goal, and at himself: not a step further will he go,- this brave one!</p>
<p>Now glows the sun upon him, and the dogs lick at his sweat: but he lies there in his obstinacy and preferrs to languish:-</p>
<p>-A span-breadth from his goal, to languish! you will have to drag him into his heaven by the hair of his head- this hero!</p>
<p>Better still that you let him lie where he has lain down, that sleep may come to him, the comforter, with cooling patter-rain.</p>
<p>Let him lie, until of his own accord he awakens,- until of his own accord he repudiates all weariness, and what weariness has taught through him!</p>
<p>Only, my brothers, see that you scare the dogs away from him, the idle skulkers, and all the swarming vermin:-</p>
<p>-All the swarming vermin of the “cultured,” that- feast on the sweat of every hero!-</p>
<p>19.</p>
<p>I form circles around me and sacred boundaries; ever fewer ascend with me ever higher mountains: I build a mountain-range out of ever holier mountains.-</p>
<p>But wherever you would ascend with me, O my brothers, take care lest a parasite ascend with you!</p>
<p>A parasite: that is a reptile, a creeping, cringing reptile, that tries to fatten on your infirm and sore places.</p>
<p>And this is its art: it divines where ascending souls are weary, in your trouble and dejection, in your sensitive modesty, does it build its loathsome nest.</p>
<p>Where the strong are weak, where the noble are all-too-gentle- there builds it its loathsome nest; the parasite lives where the great have small sore-places.</p>
<p>What is the highest of all species of being, and what is the lowest? The parasite is the lowest species; yet he who is of the highest species feeds most parasites.</p>
<p>For the soul which has the longest ladder, and can go deepest down: how could there fail to be most parasites upon it?-</p>
<p>-The most comprehensive soul, which can run and stray and rove furthest in itself; the most necessary soul, which out of joy flings itself into chance:-</p>
<p>-The soul in Being, which plunges into Becoming; the possessing soul, which seeks to attain desire and longing:-</p>
<p>-The soul fleeing from itself, which overtakes itself in the widest circuit; the wisest soul, to which folly speaks most sweetly:-</p>
<p>-The soul most self-loving, in which all things have their current and counter-current, their ebb and their flow:- oh, how could the loftiest soul fail to have the worst parasites?</p>
<p>20.</p>
<p>O my brothers, am I then cruel? But I say: What falls, that shall one also push!</p>
<p>Everything of today- it falls, it decays; who would preserve it! But I- I wish also to push it!</p>
<p>Know you the delight which rolls stones into precipitous depths?Those men of today, see just how they roll into my depths!</p>
<p>A prelude am I to better players, O my brothers! An example! Do according to my example!</p>
<p>And him whom you do not teach to fly, teach I pray you- to fall faster!-</p>
<p>21.</p>
<p>I love the brave: but it is not enough to be a swordsman,- one must also know whereon to use swordsmanship!</p>
<p>And often is it greater bravery to keep quiet and pass by, that thereby one may reserve oneself for a worthier foe!</p>
<p>You shall only have foes to be hated; but not foes to be despised: you must be proud of your foes. Thus have I already taught.</p>
<p>For the worthier foe, O my brothers, shall you reserve yourselves: therefore must you pass by many a one,-</p>
<p>-Especially many of the rabble, who din your ears with noise about people and peoples.</p>
<p>Keep your eye clear of their For and Against! There is there much right, much wrong: he who looks on becomes wroth.</p>
<p>Therein viewing, therein hewing- they are the same thing: therefore depart into the forests and lay your sword to sleep!</p>
<p>Go your ways! and let the people and peoples go theirs!- gloomy ways, verily, on which not a single hope glints any more!</p>
<p>Let there the trader rule, where all that still glitters is- traders’ gold. It is the time of kings no longer: that which now calls itself the people is unworthy of kings.</p>
<p>See how these peoples themselves now do just like the traders: they pick up the small advantage out of all kinds of rubbish!</p>
<p>They lay lures for one another, they lure things out of one another,that they call “good neighborliness.” O blessed remote period when a people said to itself: “I will be- master over peoples!”</p>
<p>For, my brothers, the best shall rule, the best also wills to rule! And where the teaching is different, there- the best is lacking.</p>
<p>22.</p>
<p>If they had- bread for nothing, alas! for what would they cry! Their maintainment- that is their true entertainment; and they shall have it hard!</p>
<p>Beasts of prey, are they: in their “working”- there is even plundering, in their “earning”- there is even over-reaching! Therefore shall they have it hard!</p>
<p>Better beasts of prey shall they thus become, subtler, cleverer, more man-like: for man is the best beast of prey.</p>
<p>All the animals has man already robbed of their virtues: that is why of all animals it has been hardest for man.</p>
<p>Only the birds are still beyond him. And if man should yet learn to fly, alas! to what height- would his rapacity fly!</p>
<p>23.</p>
<p>Thus would I have man and woman: fit for war, the one; fit for maternity, the other; both, however, fit for dancing with head and legs.</p>
<p>And lost be the day to us in which a measure has not been danced. And false be every truth which has not had laughter along with it!</p>
<p>24.</p>
<p>Your marriage-arranging: see that it be not a bad arranging! You have arranged too hastily: so there follows therefrom- marriage-breaking!</p>
<p>And better marriage-breaking than marriage-bending, marriage-lying!- Thus spoke a woman to me: “Indeed, I broke the marriage, but first did the marriage break- me!</p>
<p>The badly paired found I ever the most revengeful: they make every one suffer for it that they no longer run singly.</p>
<p>On that account want I the honest ones to say to one another: “We love each other: let us see to it that we maintain our love! Or shall our pledging be blundering?”</p>
<p>-“Give us a set term and a small marriage, that we may see if we are fit for the great marriage! It is a great matter always to be twain.”</p>
<p>Thus do I counsel all honest ones; and what would be my love to the Superman, and to all that is to come, if I should counsel and speak otherwise!</p>
<p>Not only to propagate yourselves onwards but upwards- thereto, O my brothers, may the garden of marriage help you!</p>
<p>25.</p>
<p>He who has grown wise concerning old origins, lo, he will at last seek after the fountains of the future and new origins.-</p>
<p>O my brothers, not long will it be until new peoples shall arise and new fountains shall rush down into new depths.</p>
<p>For the earthquake- it chokes up many wells, it causes much languishing: but it brings also to light inner powers and secrets.</p>
<p>The earthquake discloses new fountains. In the earthquake of old peoples new fountains burst forth.</p>
<p>And whoever calls out: “Lo, here is a well for many thirsty ones, one heart for many longing ones, one will for many instruments”:- around him collects a people, that is to say, many attempting ones.</p>
<p>Who can command, who must obey- that is there attempted! Ah, with what long seeking and solving and failing and learning and reattempting!</p>
<p>Human society: it is an attempt- so I teach- a long seeking: it seeks however the ruler!-</p>
<p>-An attempt, my brothers! And no “contract”! Destroy, I pray you, destroy that word of the soft-hearted and half-and-half!</p>
<p>26.</p>
<p>O my brothers! With whom lies the greatest danger to the whole human future? Is it not with the good and just?-</p>
<p>-As those who say and feel in their hearts: “We already know what is good and just, we possess it also; woe to those who still seek thereafter!</p>
<p>And whatever harm the wicked may do, the harm of the good is the harmfulest harm!</p>
<p>And whatever harm the world-maligners may do, the harm of the good is the harmfulest harm!</p>
<p>O my brothers, into the hearts of the good and just looked some one once on a time, who said: “They are the Pharisees.” But people did not understand him.</p>
<p>The good and just themselves were not free to understand him; their spirit was imprisoned in their good conscience. The stupidity of the good is unfathomably wise.</p>
<p>It is the truth, however, that the good must be Pharisees- they have no choice!</p>
<p>The good must crucify him who creates his own virtue! That is the truth!</p>
<p>The second one, however, who discovered their country- the country, heart and soil of the good and just,- it was he who asked: “Whom do they hate most?” The creator, hate they most, him who breaks the law-tablets and old values, the breaker,- him they call the law-breaker.</p>
<p>For the good- they cannot create; they are always the beginning of the end:-</p>
<p>-They crucify him who writes new values on new law-tablets, they sacrifice to themselves the future- they crucify the whole human future!</p>
<p>The good- they have always been the beginning of the end.-</p>
<p>27.</p>
<p>O my brothers, have you also understood this word? And what I once said of the “last man”?- -</p>
<p>With whom lies the greatest danger to the whole human future? Is it not with the good and just?</p>
<p>Break up, break up, I pray you, the good and just!- O my brothers, have you understood also this word?</p>
<p>28.</p>
<p>You flee from me? You are frightened? You tremble at this word?</p>
<p>O my brothers, when I enjoined you to break up the good, and the law-tablets of the good, then only did I embark man on his high seas.</p>
<p>And now only comes to him the great terror, the great outlook, the great sickness, the great nausea, the great seasickness.</p>
<p>False shores and false securities did the good teach you; in the lies of the good were you born and bred. Everything has been radically contorted and distorted by the good.</p>
<p>But he who discovered the country of “man,” discovered also the country of “man’s future.” Now shall you be sailors for me, brave, patient!</p>
<p>Keep yourselves up betimes, my brothers, learn to keep yourselves up! The sea storms: many seek to raise themselves again by you.</p>
<p>The sea storms: all is in the sea. Well! Cheer up! You old seamanhearts!</p>
<p>What of fatherland! There strives our helm where our children’s land is! Therewards, stormier than the sea, storms our great longing!-</p>
<p>29.</p>
<p>“Why so hard!”- said to the diamond one day the charcoal; “are we then not near relatives?”-</p>
<p>Why so soft? O my brothers; thus do I ask you: are you then not- my brothers?</p>
<p>Why so soft, so submissive and yielding? Why is there so much negation and abnegation in your hearts? Why is there so little fate in your looks?</p>
<p>And if you will not be fates and inexorable ones, how can you one day- conquer with me?</p>
<p>And if your hardness will not glance and cut and chip to pieces, how can you one day- create with me?</p>
<p>For the creators are hard. And blessed must it seem to you to press your hand upon millenniums as upon wax,-</p>
<p>-Blessed to write upon the will of millenniums as upon brass,- harder than brass, nobler than brass. Entirely hard is only the noblest.</p>
<p>This new table, O my brothers, put I up over you: Become hard!-</p>
<p>30.</p>
<p>O you, my Will! you change of every need, my needfulness! Preserve me from all small victories!</p>
<p>You fatedness of my soul, which I call fate! you In-me! Over-me! Preserve and spare me for one great fate!</p>
<p>And your last greatness, my Will, spare it for your last- that you may be inexorable in your victory! Ah, who has not perished to his victory!</p>
<p>Ah, whose eye has not bedimmed in this intoxicated twilight! Ah, whose foot has not faltered and forgotten in victory- how to stand!-</p>
<p>-That I may one day be ready and ripe in the great noon-tide: ready and ripe like the glowing ore, the lightning-bearing cloud, and the swelling milk-udder:-</p>
<p>-Ready for myself and for my most hidden Will: a bow eager for its arrow, an arrow eager for its star:-</p>
<p>-A star, ready and ripe in its noontide, glowing, pierced, blessed, by annihilating sun-arrows:-</p>
<p>-A sun itself, and an inexorable sun-will, ready for annihilation in victory!</p>
<p>O Will, you change of every need, my needfulness! Spare me for one great victory!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>
