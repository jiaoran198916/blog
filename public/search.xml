    <title>awk命令详解</title>
    <url>/p/cf83d80f/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>awk是一个强大的文本分析工具，是把文件逐行的读入，以空格为默认分隔符将每行切片，切开的部分再进行各种分析处理。</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>awk其名称得自于它的创始人 <code>Alfred Aho</code> 、<code>Peter Weinberger</code> 和 <code>Brian Kernighan</code> 姓氏的首字母。实际上 AWK 的确拥有自己的语言： AWK程序设计语言，三位创建者已将它正式定义为“样式扫描和处理语言”。它允许您创建简短的程序，这些程序读取输入文件、为数据排序、处理数据、对输入执行计算以及生成报表，还有无数其他的功能。</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="命令行"><a href="#命令行" class="headerlink" title="命令行"></a>命令行</h2><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">awk [-F  field-separator]  &#39;commands&#39;  input-file(s)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>其中，commands 是真正awk命令，[-F域分隔符]是可选的。 input-file(s) 是待处理的文件。<br>在awk中，文件的每一行中，由域分隔符分开的每一项称为一个域。默认的域分隔符是空格。</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="示例1"><a href="#示例1" class="headerlink" title="示例1"></a>示例1</h2><p>获取当前目录下所有文件大小</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ls -l |awk &#39;&#123;print $5&#125;&#39;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>读入有”\n”换行符分割的一条记录，然后将记录按指定的域分隔符划分域，填充域，$0则表示所有域,$1表示第一个域,$n表示第n个域。所以$5表示文件大小以此类推。</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="示例2"><a href="#示例2" class="headerlink" title="示例2"></a>示例2</h2><p>显示 /etc/passwd 的账户和账户对应的shell，而账户与shell之间以tab键分割，并且在所有行前添加列名name,shell,在最后一行添加”blue,/bin/nosh”</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">cat &#x2F;etc&#x2F;passwd |awk  -F &#39;:&#39;  &#39;BEGIN &#123;print &quot;name,shell&quot;&#125;  &#123;print $1&quot;,&quot;$7&#125; END &#123;print &quot;blue,&#x2F;bin&#x2F;nosh&quot;&#125;&#39;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<hr>
<h2 id="示例3"><a href="#示例3" class="headerlink" title="示例3"></a>示例3</h2><p>搜索/etc/passwd有root关键字的所有行</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">awk -F: &#39;&#x2F;^root&#x2F;&#39; &#x2F;etc&#x2F;passwd</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>pattern的使用示例，匹配了pattern(这里是以root开头)的行才会执行action(没有指定action，默认输出每行的内容)。</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="示例4"><a href="#示例4" class="headerlink" title="示例4"></a>示例4</h2><p>统计/etc/passwd:文件名，每行的行号，每行的列数，对应的完整行内容</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">awk  -F &#39;:&#39;  &#39;&#123;print &quot;filename:&quot; FILENAME &quot;,linenumber:&quot; NR &quot;,columns:&quot; NF &quot;,linecontent:&quot;$0&#125;&#39; &#x2F;etc&#x2F;passwd</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>FILENAME，NR，NF是内置变量，常用变量如下</p>
<ul>
<li>ARGC               命令行参数个数</li>
<li>ARGV               命令行参数排列</li>
<li>ENVIRON            支持队列中系统环境变量的使用</li>
<li>FILENAME           awk浏览的文件名</li>
<li>FNR                浏览文件的记录数</li>
<li>FS                 设置输入域分隔符，等价于命令行 -F选项</li>
<li>NF                 浏览记录的域的个数</li>
<li>NR                 已读的记录数</li>
<li>OFS                输出域分隔符</li>
<li>ORS                输出记录分隔符</li>
<li>RS                 控制记录分隔符</li>
</ul>
<p>结果：</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">filename:&#x2F;etc&#x2F;passwd,linenumber:1,columns:7,linecontent:root:x:0:0:root:&#x2F;root:&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>使用printf替代print，可以让代码更加简洁，易读</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">awk  -F &#39;:&#39;  &#39;&#123;printf(&quot;filename:%10s,linenumber:%s,columns:%s,linecontent:%s\n&quot;,FILENAME,NR,NF,$0)&#125;&#39; &#x2F;etc&#x2F;passwd</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

    <title>【P1C13】Chastity</title>
    <url>/p/948ca02f/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I love the forest. It is bad to live in cities: there, there are too many of the lustful.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Is it not better to fall into the hands of a murderer than into the dreams of a lustful woman?</p>
<p>And just look at these men: their eye says it- they cannot conceive of anything better on earth than to lie with a woman.</p>
<p>Filth is at the bottom of their souls; and alas! if their filth still has spirit in it!</p>
<p>If only you were perfect- at least as animals! But to animals belongs innocence.</p>
<p>Do I counsel you to kill your instincts? I counsel you to innocence in your instincts.</p>
<p>Do I counsel you to chastity? Chastity is a virtue with some, but almost a vice with many.</p>
<p>They are chaste, to be sure: but the bitch, lust, looks enviously out of all that they do.</p>
<p>Even into the heights of their virtue and into their cold spirit does this creature follow them, with its discord.</p>
<p>And how nicely can the bitch, lust, beg for a piece of spirit, when a piece of flesh is denied it!</p>
<p>You love tragedies and all that breaks the heart? But I am distrustful of your bitch.</p>
<p>Your eyes are too cruel, and you seek lustfully for sufferers. Has not your lust just disguised itself and taken the name of pity?</p>
<p>And I give this parable to you: Many who tried to cast out their devil, went themselves into swine.</p>
<p>To whom chastity is difficult, it is to be dissuaded: lest it become the road to hell- to filth and lust of soul.</p>
<p>Do I speak of filthy things? That is not the worst thing for me to do. Not when the truth is filthy, but when it is shallow, does the discerning one go unwillingly into its waters.</p>
<p>There are some who are chaste from their very nature; they are gentler of heart, and laugh better and more often than you.</p>
<p>They laugh also at chastity, and ask: “What is chastity?</p>
<p>Is chastity not folly? But this folly came to us, and not we to it.</p>
<p>We offered that guest harbor and heart: now it dwells with us- let it stay as long as it will!”Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P1C20】Child and Marriage</title>
    <url>/p/ddd0139e/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have a question for you alone, my brother: like a sounding-lead, I cast this question into your soul, that I may know its depth.</p>
<p>You are young, and desire child and marriage. But I ask you: are you a man entitled to desire a child?</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Are you the victorious one, the self-conqueror, the ruler of your passions, the master of your virtues? Thus do I ask you.</p>
<p>Or does the animal speak in your wish, and need? Or loneliness? Or discord in you?</p>
<p>Let your victory and freedom long for a child. You shall build living monuments to your victory and freedom.</p>
<p>You shall build beyond yourself. But first of all you must be built yourself, solid in body and soul.</p>
<p>You shall propagate yourself not only onward, but upward! For that purpose may the garden of marriage help you!</p>
<p>You shall create a higher body, a first movement, a spontaneously rolling wheel- you shall create a creator.</p>
<p>Marriage: so call I the will of the two to create the one that is more than those who created it. The reverence for one another, as those exercising such a will, I call marriage.</p>
<p>Let this be the significance and the truth of your marriage. But that which the all-too-many call marriage, those superfluous ones- ah, what shall I call it?</p>
<p>Ah, the poverty of soul in the two! Ah, the filth of soul in the two! Ah, the pitiable self-complacency in the two!</p>
<p>They call it marriage; and they say their marriages are made in heaven.</p>
<p>Well I do not like that heaven of the superfluous! No, I do not like them, those animals tangled in the heavenly net!</p>
<p>Keep far from me that God who limps near to bless what he has not matched!</p>
<p>Do not laugh at such marriages! What child has not had reason to weep over its parents?</p>
<p>This man seemed worthy, and ripe for the meaning of the earth: but when I saw his wife, the earth seemed to me an asylum of madmen.</p>
<p>Yes, I wish that the earth shook with convulsions when a saint and a goose mate with one another.</p>
<p>This one went forth in quest of truth as a hero, and at last got for himself a small dressed-up lie: his marriage he calls it.</p>
<p>That one was reserved and chose warily. But then he spoilt his company for all time: his marriage he calls it.</p>
<p>Another sought a handmaid with the virtues of an angel. But then he became the handmaid of a woman, and now he must become an angel.</p>
<p>Careful, have I found all buyers, and all of them have astute eyes. But even the most astute of them buys his wife in a poke.</p>
<p>Many brief follies- that you call love. And your marriage puts an end to your many brief follies, with one long stupidity.</p>
<p>Your love of woman, and woman’s love of man- ah, if only it were sympathy for suffering and veiled gods! But usually, two animals find each another.</p>
<p>But even your best love is only an enraptured parable and a painful ardor. It is a torch to light loftier paths for you.</p>
<p>You shall love beyond yourselves some day! So first, learn to love. And for that you have to drink the bitter cup of your love.</p>
<p>Bitterness is in the cup even of the best love; thus does it cause longing for the Superman; thus does it cause thirst in you, the creator!</p>
<p>Thirst in the creator, arrow and longing for the Superman: tell me, my brother, is this your will to marriage?</p>
<p>Sacred I call such a will, and such a marriage.</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>打水印命令convert详解</title>
    <url>/p/6ab45c92/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>打水印时主要用的是PHP扩展ImageMagick，该扩展专门用于处理图片，功能丰富，使用灵活，详细介绍可参看<a href="https://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-processing.php">官方文档</a>.</p>
<p>基本操作有打水印、裁剪、划线、画矩形、格式转换等。其中打水印命令最为复杂，下面对其中的参数和选项做个梳理。</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">convert +profile <span class="string">&#x27;*&#x27;</span> <span class="built_in">source</span> -quality 80 -resize <span class="string">&#x27;800x600&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line">water.png -gravity southeast -geometry +0+0 -composite</span><br><span class="line">-fill rgba\(255,255,255,0.35\) -font fzltchjt.TTF</span><br><span class="line">-pointsize 20 -stroke rgba\(0,0,0,0.22\) -strokewidth 1</span><br><span class="line">-gravity SouthEast -draw <span class="string">&quot;text 28,15 &#x27;贴图ID:188916&#x27;&quot;</span> dest</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<ul>
<li>+profile<br>Use <code>+profile profile_name</code> to remove the indicated profile.<br><code>*</code>代表去除所有。但没弄懂profile是啥。</li>
<li>source 原图片</li>
<li>quality 质量，品质</li>
<li>resize 重新设置大小，以上两项均针对原图片source</li>
<li>water.png 水印图片</li>
<li>southeast 和 geometry 指定图片叠加位置，遵循地理位置，上北下南左西右东，southeast就是右下角，geometry指定相对原点的偏移值，有很多写法，默认是 +0+0，可省略</li>
<li>composite 代表用多个图片合并起来，这里应该是将两个图片（source和water.png）叠加起来</li>
<li>(下面一些是对添加水印字体的设置)</li>
<li>fill 字体颜色</li>
<li>font 指定字体</li>
<li>pointsize 字体大小，像素为单位</li>
<li>stroke 描边颜色</li>
<li>strokewidth 描边宽度</li>
<li>-gravity SouthEast 第二个指定水印字体相对位置，此处如同上面相同可省略</li>
<li>draw 绘制字体 text 28,15 代表相对水平和垂直位置，后面是具体值</li>
<li>dest 目标输出图片</li>
</ul>
<p>关于路径写法，绝对路径和相对路径都支持，但输出图片时不允许新建目录。</p>
<p>测试过部分参数，不知道理解的对不对，原参数实在太多了 -_-||</p>

    <title>9、对象创建模式</title>
    <url>/p/a879112e/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>一共5种，除了工厂函数不常用外，其他都很常用。</p>
<h2 id="方式一-Object构造函数模式"><a href="#方式一-Object构造函数模式" class="headerlink" title="方式一: Object构造函数模式"></a>方式一: Object构造函数模式</h2><ul>
<li>套路: 先创建空Object对象, 再动态添加属性/方法</li>
<li>适用场景: 起始时不确定对象内部数据</li>
<li>问题: 语句太多</li>
</ul>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">var obj &#x3D; new Object()</span><br><span class="line">obj.name &#x3D; &#39;Tom&#39;</span><br><span class="line">obj.setName &#x3D; function(name)&#123;this.name&#x3D;name&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="方式二-对象字面量模式"><a href="#方式二-对象字面量模式" class="headerlink" title="方式二: 对象字面量模式"></a>方式二: 对象字面量模式</h2><ul>
<li>套路: 使用{}创建对象, 同时指定属性/方法</li>
<li>适用场景: 起始时对象内部数据是确定的</li>
<li>问题: 如果创建多个对象, 有重复代码</li>
</ul>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">var p &#x3D; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  name: &#39;Tom&#39;,</span><br><span class="line">  age: 12,</span><br><span class="line">  setName: function (name) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    this.name &#x3D; name</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<hr>
<h2 id="方式三-工厂模式"><a href="#方式三-工厂模式" class="headerlink" title="方式三: 工厂模式"></a>方式三: 工厂模式</h2><ul>
<li>套路: 通过工厂函数动态创建对象并返回</li>
<li>适用场景: 需要创建多个对象</li>
<li>问题: 对象没有一个具体的类型, 都是Object类型</li>
</ul>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">function createPerson(name, age) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  var obj &#x3D; &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    name: name,</span><br><span class="line">    age: age,</span><br><span class="line">    setName: function (name) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      this.name &#x3D; name</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  return obj</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="方式四-自定义构造函数模式"><a href="#方式四-自定义构造函数模式" class="headerlink" title="方式四: 自定义构造函数模式"></a>方式四: 自定义构造函数模式</h2><ul>
<li>套路: 自定义构造函数, 通过new创建对象</li>
<li>适用场景: 需要创建多个类型确定的对象</li>
<li>问题: 每个对象都有相同的数据, 浪费内存</li>
</ul>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">function Person(name, age) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  this.name &#x3D; name;</span><br><span class="line">  this.age &#x3D; age;</span><br><span class="line">  this.setName &#x3D; function(name)&#123;this.name&#x3D;name;&#125;;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">new Person(&#39;tom&#39;, 12);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

    <title>【P1C21】Free Death</title>
    <url>/p/76672179/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Many die too late, and some die too early. Yet strange sounds the precept: “Die at the right time!</p>
<p>Die at the right time: thus teaches Zarathustra.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>To be sure, how could he who never lives at the right time ever die at the right time? If only he had never been born!- Thus do I advise the superfluous.</p>
<p>But even the superfluous make a show of their death, and even the hollowest nut wants to be cracked.</p>
<p>All regard dying as a great matter: but as yet death is not a festival. People have not yet learned to inaugurate the finest festivals.</p>
<p>I teach you the death which consummates, and becomes a spur and promise to the living.</p>
<p>He who consummates his life, then dies triumphant, surrounded by those who hope and promise.</p>
<p>Thus should one learn to die; and there should be no festival at which one who dies in this way does not consecrate the oaths of the living!</p>
<p>Thus to die is best; the next best, however, is to die in battle, and squander a great soul.</p>
<p>But equally hateful to vanquished and victor, is the grinning death which steals nigh like a thief,- and yet comes as master.</p>
<p>My death I praise to you, the voluntary death, which comes to me because I want it.</p>
<p>And when shall I want it?- He that has a goal and an heir, wants death at the right time for the goal and the heir.</p>
<p>And from reverence for the goal and heir, he will hang no more withered wreaths in the sanctuary of life.</p>
<p>I will not imitate the rope-makers: they lengthen out their cord and always walk backward.</p>
<p>And many grow too old for their truths and triumphs; a toothless mouth no longer has the right to every truth.</p>
<p>And whoever wants fame must take leave of honor and practice the difficult art of- leaving at the right time.</p>
<p>One must stop being eaten when one tastes best: those who want to be long loved know this.</p>
<p>There are sour apples, no doubt, whose lot is to wait until the last day of autumn: and at once they become ripe, yellow, and shrivelled.</p>
<p>In some the heart ages first, and in others the spirit. And some are hoary in youth, but those who are young latest keep young longer.</p>
<p>To many men life is a failure; a poison-worm gnaws at their heart. Then at least let their dying be a success.</p>
<p>Many never become sweet; they rot even in the summer. Cowardice holds them fast to their branches.</p>
<p>Far too many live, and far too long do they hang on their branches. If only a storm would come and shake all that is rotten and worm-eaten from the tree!</p>
<p>If only there were preachers of quick death! They would be the right storms and shakers of the trees of life! But I hear only the slow death preached, and patience with all that is “earthly.”</p>
<p>Ah! you preach patience with what is earthly? It is the earthly that has too much patience with you, you blasphemers!</p>
<p>Too early died that Hebrew whom the preachers of slow death honor: and it is a calamity to many that he died too early.</p>
<p>As yet he knew only tears, and the melancholy of the Hebrews, and hatred of the good and just- the Hebrew Jesus: then he was seized with longing for death.</p>
<p>If only he had remained in the wilderness, far from the good the just! Perhaps then he would have learned to live and love the earth- and laughter also!</p>
<p>Believe me, my brothers! He died too early; he himself would have recanted his doctrine had he reached my age! He was noble enough to recant!</p>
<p>But he was still immature. The youth loves immaturely, and he also hates immaturely both man and earth. His soul and the wings of his spirit are still confined and awkward.</p>
<p>But in man there is more of the child than in the youth, and less melancholy: he better understands life and death.</p>
<p>Free for death, and free in death; a sacred Nosayer, when there is no longer time for Yes: thus he understands death and life.</p>
<p>That your dying be no reproach to man and the earth, my friends: that I ask of the honey of your soul.</p>
<p>In your dying, your spirit and your virtue shall still shine like an sunset around the earth: otherwise your dying has gone badly.</p>
<p>Thus I will die myself, that you, my friends, may love the earth more for my sake; and earth will I again become, to have rest in her that bore me.</p>
<p>Zarathustra had a goal; he threw his ball. Now you, my friends, are the heirs of my goal; to you I throw the golden ball.</p>
<p>I like best of all to see you, my friends, throw the golden ball! And so I tarry a little while on the earth- pardon me for it!</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <url>/p/2e448025/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The figs fall from the trees, they are good and sweet; and in falling the red skins of them break. A north wind am I to ripe figs.</p>
<p>Thus, like figs, do these doctrines fall for you, my friends: imbibe now their juice and their sweet substance! It is autumn all around, and clear sky, and afternoon.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Lo, what fullness is around us! And out of the midst of superabundance, it is delightful to look out upon distant seas.</p>
<p>Once did people say God, when they looked out upon distant seas; now, however, have I taught you to say, Superman.</p>
<p>God is a conjecture: but I do not wish your conjecturing to reach beyond your creating will.</p>
<p>Could you create a God?- Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods! But you could well create the Superman.</p>
<p>Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and forefathers of the Superman could you transform yourselves: and let that be your best creating!-</p>
<p>God is a conjecture: but I should like your conjecturing restricted to the conceivable.</p>
<p>Could you conceive a God?- But let this mean Will to Truth to you, that everything be transformed into the humanly conceivable, the humanly visible, the humanly sensible! Your own discernment shall you follow out to the end!</p>
<p>And what you have called the world shall but be created by you: your reason, your likeness, your will, your love, shall it itself become! And verily, for your bliss, you discerning ones!</p>
<p>And how would you endure life without that hope, you discerning ones? Neither in the inconceivable could you have been born, nor in the irrational.</p>
<p>But that I may reveal my heart entirely to you, my friends: if there were gods, how could I endure it to be no God! Therefore there are no gods.</p>
<p>Yes, I have drawn the conclusion; now, however, does it draw me.-</p>
<p>God is a conjecture: but who could drink all the bitterness of this conjecture without dying? Shall his faith be taken from the creator, and from the eagle his flights into eagle-heights?</p>
<p>God is a thought- it makes all the straight crooked, and all that stands reel. What? Time would be gone, and all the perishable would be but a lie?</p>
<p>To think this is giddiness and vertigo to human limbs, and even vomiting to the stomach: verily, the reeling sickness do I call it, to conjecture such a thing.</p>
<p>Evil do I call it and misanthropic: all that teaching about the one, and the plenum, and the unmoved, and the sufficient, and the imperishable!</p>
<p>All the imperishable- that’s but a parable, and the poets lie too much.-</p>
<p>But of time and of becoming shall the best parables speak: a praise shall they be, and a justification of all perishing!</p>
<p>Creating- that is the great salvation from suffering, and life’s alleviation. But for the creator to appear, suffering itself is needed, and much transformation.</p>
<p>Yes, much bitter dying must there be in your life, you creators! Thus are you advocates and justifiers of all perishing.</p>
<p>For the creator himself to be the new-born child, he must also be willing to be the child-bearer, and endure the pangs of the child-bearer.</p>
<p>Through a hundred souls went I my way, and through a hundred cradles and birth-throes. Many a farewell have I taken; I know the heartbreaking last hours.</p>
<p>But so wills it my creating Will, my fate. Or, to tell you it more candidly: just such a fate- wills my Will.</p>
<p>All feeling suffers in me, and is in prison: but my willing ever comes to me as my emancipator and comforter.</p>
<p>Willing emancipates: that is the true doctrine of will and emancipation- so teaches you Zarathustra.</p>
<p>No longer willing, and no longer valuing, and no longer creating! Ah, that that great debility may ever be far from me!</p>
<p>And also in discerning do I feel only my will’s procreating and evolving delight; and if there be innocence in my knowledge, it is because there is will to procreation in it.</p>
<p>Away from God and gods did this will allure me; what would there be to create if there were- gods!</p>
<p>But to man does it ever impel me anew, my fervent creative will; thus impels it the hammer to the stone.</p>
<p>Ah, you men, within the stone slumbers an image for me, the image of my visions! Ah, that it should slumber in the hardest, ugliest stone!</p>
<p>Now rages my hammer ruthlessly against its prison. From the stone fly the fragments: what’s that to me?</p>
<p>I will complete it: for a shadow came to me- the still and lightest of all things once came to me!</p>
<p>The beauty of the Superman came to me as a shadow. Ah, my brothers! Of what account now are- the gods to me!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P1C5】Joys and Passions</title>
    <url>/p/d32c0929/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>My brother, when you have a virtue, and it is your own virtue, you have it in common with no one.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>To be sure, you would call it by name and caress it; you would tug its ears and amuse yourself with it.</p>
<p>And lo! Then have you its name in common with the people, and have become one of the people and the herd with your virtue!</p>
<p>Better for you to say: “Inexpressible and nameless is that which gives pain and sweetness to my soul, and is the hunger of my bowels.”</p>
<p>Let your virtue be too exalted for the familiarity of names, and if you must speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it.</p>
<p>Thus speak and stammer: “This is my good, this I love, thus does it please me entirely, thus alone do I want the good.</p>
<p>I do not want it as divine law, not as a human law or a human need; it will not be a guide-post for me to over-earths and paradises.</p>
<p>It is an earthly virtue which I love: there is little prudence in it, and least of all any common wisdom.</p>
<p>But that bird built its nest with me: therefore, I love and cherish itnow it sits with me on its golden eggs.”</p>
<p>Thus should you stammer, and praise your virtue.</p>
<p>Once you had passions and called them evil. But now you have only your virtues: they grew out of your passions.</p>
<p>You implanted your highest goal into the heart of those passions: then they became your virtues and joys.</p>
<p>And though you were of the race of the hot-tempered, or of the voluptuous, or of the fanatical, or the vindictive;</p>
<p>All your passions in the end became virtues, and all your devils angels.</p>
<p>32 Once had you wild dogs in your cellar: but they changed at last into birds and charming singers.</p>
<p>Out of your poisons you brewed your balsam; you milked your cow, melancholy- now you drink the sweet milk of her udder.</p>
<p>And nothing evil grows in you any longer, unless it be the evil that grows out of the conflict of your virtues.</p>
<p>My brother, if you are fortunate, then you have one virtue and no more: thus you will go easier over the bridge.</p>
<p>It is illustrious to have many virtues, but a hard lot; and many a one has gone into the wilderness and killed himself, because he was weary of being the battle and battlefield of virtues.</p>
<p>My brother, are war and battle evil? But this evil is necessary; necessary are the envy and the distrust and the back-biting among the virtues.</p>
<p>Behold how each of your virtues is covetous of the highest place; each wants your whole spirit to be her herald, it wants your whole power, in wrath, hatred, and love.</p>
<p>Each virtue is jealous of the others, and jealousy is a terrible thing. Even virtues may perish of jealousy.</p>
<p>He whom the flame of jealousy encompasses, will at last, like the scorpion, turn the poisoned sting against himself.</p>
<p>Ah! my brother, have you never seen a virtue backbite and stab itself?</p>
<p>Man is something that must be overcome: and therefore you will love your virtues,- for you will perish by them.-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

<li>让函数外部可以操作(读写)到函数内部的数据(变量/函数)</li>
<li>函数执行完后, 函数内部声明的局部变量是否还存在?  //一般是不存在, 存在于闭中的变量才可能存在</li>
<li>在函数外部能直接访问函数内部的局部变量吗? //不能, 但我们可以通过闭包让外部操作它</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>闭包的生命周期<ul>
<li>产生: 在嵌套内部函数定义执行完时就产生了(不是在调用)</li>
<li>死亡: 在嵌套的内部函数成为垃圾对象时，<code>f = null</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>闭包应用:<ul>
<li>模块化: 封装一些数据以及操作数据的函数, 向外暴露一些行为<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">  (<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> (<span class="params">window</span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">//私有的数据</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">var</span> msg = <span class="string">&#x27;atguigu&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">var</span> names = [<span class="string">&#x27;I&#x27;</span>, <span class="string">&#x27;Love&#x27;</span>, <span class="string">&#x27;you&#x27;</span>]</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">//操作数据的函数</span></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">a</span>(<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">      <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(msg.toUpperCase())</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span> <span class="title">b</span>(<span class="params"></span>) </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">      <span class="built_in">console</span>.log(names.join(<span class="string">&#x27; &#x27;</span>))</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="built_in">window</span>.coolModule2 =  &#123;</span><br><span class="line">      doSomething: a,</span><br><span class="line">      doOtherthing: b</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;)(<span class="built_in">window</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></li>
<li>循环遍历加监听</li>
<li>JS框架(jQuery)大量使用了闭包</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>缺点:<ul>
<li>变量占用内存的时间可能会过长</li>
<li>可能导致内存泄露</li>
<li>解决:<ul>
<li>及时释放 : f = null; //让内部函数对象成为垃圾对象</li>

    <title>JS中 Number()方法的两种用法</title>
    <url>/p/ad62e574/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>JS中，调用Number()主要有两种方式，一是作为一个 function 将任意类型的数据转换成数值，二是作为一个类，通过new 生成一个数值对象。  </p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>其中第一种方式更常用。</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="用法一：function"><a href="#用法一：function" class="headerlink" title="用法一：function"></a>用法一：function</h2><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Number(value)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>将一个任意类型的数据转换成数值，无法转换的则返回 NaN，转换规则类似于类型隐式转换，与 <code>parseFloat</code> 略有差异。</p>
<p>转换规则如下：</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>值 Value</th>
<th>结果 Result</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>undefined</td>
<td>NaN</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>null</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>false</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>true</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>number</td>
<td>原样输出</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>string</td>
<td>忽略前后空格，碰到第一个非数字字符为止，空字符串返回 0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>object</td>
<td>调用内部 ToPrimitive(value, Number)，如果是 Date 对象，返回从 1970年1月1日至Date的毫秒数</td>
</tr>

    <title>JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE的作用与理解</title>
    <url>/p/8157d8ea/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="背景"><a href="#背景" class="headerlink" title="背景"></a>背景</h2><p>在使用json_encode转换的时候，默认情况下中文会转换成 <code>\u***</code> 的格式, 不仅不可读，还会在一定程度上增加传输的数据量.</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&lt;?php</span><br><span class="line">echo json_encode(&quot;中文&quot;);</span><br><span class="line">&#x2F;&#x2F;&quot;\u4e2d\u6587&quot;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>在PHP5.4, 这个问题得以解决, Json新增了一个选项: JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE,加上之后就可以正确输出中文。<br>详见鸟哥的文章，<a href="https://www.laruence.com/2011/10/10/2239.html">让Json更懂中文</a></p>
<h2 id="总结"><a href="#总结" class="headerlink" title="总结"></a>总结</h2><p>对这个选项的作用和用法都没有歧义，有点不同的是对这个组合词 JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE 的理解，鸟哥文章中说是”顾名思义，不要编码Unicode”，实际上并这里的意思并不明显，escape是避开，避免的意思，前面加上 un 表示否定，是不要避开不要避免，应该是说把Unicode当成本身处理，不要避开Unicode这种字符或格式，即承认它，再结合官网对这个选项的解释，(逐个字符的编码多字节Unicode字符)<br><code>Encode multibyte Unicode characters literally (default is to escape as \uXXXX).</code><br>，虽然最后结果是一样的，但从字义上其实很难一下子看出来。</p>

<p>Do I advise you to love of the neighbor? Rather do I advise you to flight from the neighbor and to love of the farthest!</p>
<p>Higher than love of your neighbor is love of the farthest and future ones; higher still than love to men, is love to things and phantoms.</p>
<p>The phantom that runs on before you, my brother, is fairer than you; why do you not give to it your flesh and your bones? But you are afraid, and run to your neighbor.</p>
<p>You cannot endure yourselves and do not love yourselves sufficiently: so you seek to mislead your neighbor into love, to gild yourselves with his error.</p>
<p>If only you could not endure any kinds of neighbors; then you would have to create your friend and his overflowing heart out of yourselves.</p>
<p>You call in a witness when you want to speak well of yourselves; and when you have misled him to think well of you, you also think well of yourselves.</p>
<p>Not only does he lie, who speaks when he knows better, but more so, he who speaks when he knows nothing. And thus you speak of yourselves, and lie to your neighbor with yourselves.</p>
<p>Thus says the fool: “Association with men spoils the character, especially when one has none.”</p>
<p>The one goes to his neighbor because he seeks himself, and the other because he would rather lose himself. Your bad love of yourselves makes solitude a prison to you.</p>
<p>It is the farthest ones who pay for your love to the near ones; and even when there are five of you together, there is always a sixth who must die.</p>
<p>I do not love your festivals either: I found too many actors there, and even the spectators often behaved like actors.</p>
<p>Not the neighbor do I teach you, but the friend. Let the friend be the festival of the earth to you, and a foretaste of the Superman.</p>
<p>I teach you the friend and his overflowing heart. But one must know how to be a sponge, if one would be loved by over-flowing hearts.</p>
<p>I teach you the friend in whom the world stands complete, a capsule of the good,- the creating friend, who always has a complete world to give away.</p>
<p>And as the world unrolled itself for him, so rolls it together again for him in rings, as the becoming of good through evil, as the becoming of purpose out of chance.</p>
<p>Let the future and the farthest be the motive of your today; in your friend you shall love the Superman as your motive.</p>
<p>My brothers, I advise you not to love of the neighbor- I advise you to love of the farthest!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>thinkPHP模型调试之查看执行的SQL语句</title>
    <url>/p/65fe8651/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="调试执行的SQL语句"><a href="#调试执行的SQL语句" class="headerlink" title="调试执行的SQL语句"></a>调试执行的SQL语句</h2><p>在模型操作中 ，为了更好的查明错误，经常需要查看下最近使用的SQL语句，我们可以用 <code>getLastsql</code> 方法来输出上次执行的sql语句。例如：</p>
<figure class="highlight php"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$User = M(<span class="string">&quot;User&quot;</span>); <span class="comment">// 实例化User对象</span></span><br><span class="line">$User-&gt;find(<span class="number">1</span>);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">echo</span> $User-&gt;getLastSql();</span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">// 3.2版本中可以使用简化的方法</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">echo</span> $User-&gt;_sql();</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>并且每个模型都使用独立的最后SQL记录，互不干扰，但是可以用空模型的getLastSql方法获取全局的最后SQL语句。</p>
<figure class="highlight php"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">echo</span> M()-&gt;getLastSql();</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<hr>
<h2 id="fetchSql"><a href="#fetchSql" class="headerlink" title="fetchSql"></a>fetchSql</h2><p>模型连贯操作之一 <code>fetchSql</code> 用于直接返回SQL而不是执行查询，适用于任何的CURD操作方法。 例如：</p>
<figure class="highlight php"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$result = M(<span class="string">&#x27;User&#x27;</span>)-&gt;fetchSql(<span class="literal">true</span>)-&gt;find(<span class="number">1</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<hr>
<h2 id="调试数据库错误信息"><a href="#调试数据库错误信息" class="headerlink" title="调试数据库错误信息"></a>调试数据库错误信息</h2><p>在模型操作中，还可以获取数据库的错误信息，例如：</p>
<figure class="highlight php"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$User = M(<span class="string">&quot;User&quot;</span>);</span><br><span class="line">$result = $User-&gt;find(<span class="number">1</span>);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span>(<span class="literal">false</span> === $result)&#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">echo</span> $User-&gt;getDbError();</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>CURD操作如果返回值为false，表示数据库操作发生错误，这时就需要使用模型的getDbError方法来查看数据库返回的具体错误信息。</p>

    <title>【P1C18】Old and Young Women</title>
    <url>/p/7de1690d/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Why do you steal along so furtively in the twilight, Zarathustra? And what do you hide so carefully under your cloak?</p>
<p>Is it a treasure that has been given to you? Or a child that has been born to you? Or do you go on a thief’s errand, you friend of evil?-</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>My brother, said Zarathustra, it is a treasure that has been given me: I carry a little truth.</p>
<p>But it is naughty, like a young child; and if I do not hold its mouth, it screams too loudly.</p>
<p>As I went on my way alone today, at sunset I met an old woman, and she spoke thus to my soul:</p>
<p>“Much has Zarathustra spoken also to us women, but never spoke he to us concerning woman.”</p>
<p>And I answered her: “About woman, one should speak only to men.”</p>
<p>“Talk also to me of woman,” said she; “I am old enough to forget it presently.”</p>
<p>And I obliged the old woman and spoke thus to her:</p>
<p>Everything in woman is a riddle, and everything in woman has one answer- it is called pregnancy.</p>
<p>Man is for woman a means: the purpose is always the child. But what is woman for man?</p>
<p>The real man wants two different things: danger and play. Therefore he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything.</p>
<p>Man shall be trained for war, and woman for the recreation of the warrior: all else is folly.</p>
<p>The warrior does not like fruits which are too sweet. Therefore he likes woman;- bitter is even the sweetest woman.</p>
<p>Woman understands children better than man does, but man is more childish than woman.</p>
<p>In a real man there is a child hidden: it wants to play. Up then, you women, and discover the child in man!</p>
<p>Let woman be a plaything, pure and fine like the precious stone, illumined with the virtues of a world not yet come.</p>
<p>Let the beam of a star shine in your love! Let your hope say: “May I give birth to the Superman!”</p>
<p>In your love let there be courage! With your love you shall attack him who causes you fear!</p>
<p>In your love let there be honor! Little does woman understand about honor otherwise. But let this be your honor: always to love more than you are loved, and never to be second.</p>
<p>Let man fear woman when she loves: then she makes every sacrifice, and everything else she regards as worthless.</p>
<p>Let man fear woman when she hates: for man in his innermost soul is merely evil; woman, however, is bad.</p>
<p>Whom does woman hate most?- Thus spoke the iron to the magnet: “I hate you most, because you attract me, but are too weak to draw me to you.”</p>
<p>The happiness of man is, “I will.” The happiness of woman is, “He wills.”</p>
<p>“Lo! “Lo! now has the world become perfect!”- thus thinks every woman when she obeys with all her love.</p>
<p>The woman must obey, and find a depth for her surface. Woman’s soul is all surface, a mobile, stormy film on shallow water.</p>
<p>Man’s soul, however, is deep, its torrent thunders in subterranean caverns: woman feels his strength, but does not understand it.</p>
<p>Then the old woman answered me: “Many fine things has Zarathustra said, especially for those who are young enough for them.</p>
<p>Strange! Zarathustra knows little about woman, and yet he is right about her! Is this because with woman nothing is impossible?</p>
<p>And now accept a little truth by way of thanks! I am old enough for it!</p>
<p>Swaddle it up and hold its mouth: otherwise it will scream too loudly, the little truth.”</p>
<p>“ Woman, give me your little truth!” I said. And thus spoke the old woman:</p>
<p>“You go to women? Do not forget the whip!”</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>5、原型与原型链</title>
    <url>/p/e8f85541/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>显式原型与隐式原型<ul>
<li>每个函数都有一个 <code>prototype</code> 属性, 称为显式原型属性，默认指向一个 Object空对象, 即原型对象</li>
<li>原型对象中有一个属性 constructor, 它指向函数对象</li>
<li>所有实例对象都有一个特别的属性，<code>__proto__</code>，称为隐式原型属性</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>显式原型与隐式原型的关系<ul>
<li>函数的prototype: 定义函数时被自动赋值, 值默认为{}, 即用为原型对象</li>
<li>实例对象的<strong>proto</strong>: 在创建实例对象时被自动添加, 并赋值为构造函数的prototype值</li>
<li>原型对象即为当前实例对象的父对象</li>
<li>给原型对象添加属性(一般是方法), 实例对象可以访问</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>原型链<ul>
<li>所有的实例对象都有<strong>proto</strong>属性, 它指向的就是原型对象</li>
<li>这样通过<strong>proto</strong>属性就形成了一个链的结构—-&gt;原型链</li>
<li>当查找对象内部的属性/方法时, js引擎自动沿着这个原型链查找,如果最终没找到, 返回undefined</li>
<li>当给对象属性赋值时不会使用原型链, 而只是在当前对象中进行操作</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>注意<ul>
<li>函数的显示原型指向的对象默认是空Object实例对象(但Object不满足)</li>
<li>所有函数都是Function的实例(包含Function) ，Function是通过new自己产生的实例<br><code>Function = new Function()</code></li>
<li>Object的原型对象是原型链尽头<br><code>Object.prototype.__proto__ === null</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>探索 instanceof<ul>
<li>表达式: A instanceof B</li>
<li>如果B函数的显式原型对象在A对象的原型链上, 返回true, 否则返回false<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="built_in">Object</span> <span class="keyword">instanceof</span> <span class="built_in">Function</span>) <span class="comment">// true</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="built_in">Object</span> <span class="keyword">instanceof</span> <span class="built_in">Object</span>) <span class="comment">// true</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="built_in">Function</span> <span class="keyword">instanceof</span> <span class="built_in">Function</span>) <span class="comment">// true</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="built_in">console</span>.log(<span class="built_in">Function</span> <span class="keyword">instanceof</span> <span class="built_in">Object</span>) <span class="comment">// true</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>That everyone is allowed to learn to read, ruins in the long run not only writing but also thinking.</p>
<p>Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even becomes rabble.</p>
<p>He that writes in blood and aphorisms does not want to be read, but learnt by heart.</p>
<p>In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that route you must have long legs. Aphorisms should be peaks, and those spoken to should be tall and lofty.</p>
<p>The atmosphere rare and pure, danger near and the spirit full of a joyful wickedness: these things go well together.</p>
<p>I want to have goblins about me, for I am courageous. Courage which scares away ghosts, creates goblins for itself- it wants to laugh.</p>
<p>I no longer feel as you do; the very cloud which I see beneath me, the blackness and heaviness at which I laugh- that is your thunder-cloud.</p>
<p>You look aloft when you long for exaltation; and I look downward because I am exalted.</p>
<p>Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted?</p>
<p>He who climbs high mountains, laughs at all tragic plays and tragic realities.</p>
<p>Brave, unconcerned, mocking, violent- thus wisdom wants us; wisdom is a woman, and always loves only a warrior.</p>
<p>You tell me, “Life is hard to bear.” But why should you have your pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening?</p>
<p>Life is hard to bear: but do not pretend to be so delicate! We are all of us fine sumpter asses and she-asses.</p>
<p>What do we have in common with the rose-bud, which trembles because a drop of dew lies on it?</p>
<p>It is true we love life; not because we are wont to live, but because we are wont to love.</p>
<p>There is always some madness in love. But there is always, also, some method in madness.</p>
<p>And to me also, who appreciates life, the butterflies, and soap-bubbles, and whatever is like them, seem to know most about happiness.</p>
<p>To see these light, foolish, pretty, lively little sprites flit about- that moves Zarathustra to tears and songs.</p>
<p>I would only believe in a God who could dance.</p>
<p>And when I saw my devil, I found him serious, thorough, profound, solemn: he was the spirit of gravity- through him all things fall.</p>
<p>Not by wrath, but by laughter, do we kill. Come, let us kill the spirit of gravity!</p>
<p>I learned to walk; since then have I let myself run. I learned to fly; since then I do not need to be pushed to move from a spot.</p>
<p>Now I am light, now I fly, now I see myself beneath myself, now a god dances through me.Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C12】Self-Overcoming</title>
    <url>/p/39613906/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>“Will to Truth” do you call it, you wisest ones, that which impels you and makes you ardent?</p>
<p>Will for the thinkableness of all being: thus do I call your will!</p>
<p>All being would you make thinkable: for you doubt with good reason whether it be already thinkable.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>But it shall accommodate and bend itself to you! So wills your will. Smooth shall it become and subject to the spirit, as its mirror and reflection.</p>
<p>That is your entire will, you wisest ones, as a Will to Power; and even when you speak of good and evil, and of estimates of value.</p>
<p>You would still create a world before which you can bow the knee: such is your ultimate hope and ecstasy.</p>
<p>The ignorant, to be sure, the people- they are like a river on which a boat floats along: and in the boat sit the estimates of value, solemn and disguised.</p>
<p>Your will and your valuations have you put on the river of becoming; it betrays to me an old Will to Power, what is believed by the people as good and evil.</p>
<p>It was you, you wisest ones, who put such guests in this boat, and gave them pomp and proud names- you and your ruling Will!</p>
<p>Onward the river now carries your boat: it must carry it. A small matter if the rough wave foams and angrily resists its keel!</p>
<p>It is not the river that is your danger and the end of your good and evil, you wisest ones: but that Will itself, the Will to Power- the unexhausted, procreating life-will.</p>
<p>But that you may understand my gospel of good and evil, for that purpose will I tell you my gospel of life, and of the nature of all living things.</p>
<p>The living thing did I follow; I walked in the broadest and narrowest paths to learn its nature.</p>
<p>With a hundred-faced mirror did I catch its glance when its mouth was shut, so that its eye might speak to me. And its eye spoke to me.</p>
<p>But wherever I found living things, there heard I also the language of obedience. All living things are obeying things.</p>
<p>And this heard I secondly: Whatever cannot obey itself, is commanded. Such is the nature of living things.</p>
<p>This, however, is the third thing which I heard- namely, that commanding is more difficult than obeying. And not only because the commander bears the burden of all obeyers, and because this burden readily crushes him:-</p>
<p>An attempt and a risk seemed all commanding to me; and whenever it commands, the living thing risks itself thereby.</p>
<p>Yes, even when it commands itself, then also must it atone for its commanding. Of its own law must it become the judge and avenger and victim.</p>
<p>How does this happen! So did I ask myself. What persuades the living thing to obey, and command, and even be obedient in commanding?</p>
<p>Hearken now to my word, you wisest ones! Test it seriously, whether I have crept into the heart of life itself, and into the roots of its heart!</p>
<p>Wherever I found a living thing, there found I Will to Power; and even in the will of the servant found I the will to be master.</p>
<p>That to the stronger the weaker shall serve- thereto persuades he his will who would be master over a still weaker one. That delight alone he is unwilling to forego.</p>
<p>And as the lesser surrenders himself to the greater that he may have delight and power over the least of all, so do even the greatest surrender himself, and stakes- life, for the sake of power.</p>
<p>It is the surrender of the greatest to run risk and danger, and play dice for death.</p>
<p>And where there is sacrifice and service and love-glances, there also is the will to be master. By by-ways do the weaker then slink into the fortress, and into the heart of the mightier one- and there steals power.</p>
<p>And this secret spoke Life herself to me. “Behold,” said she, “I am that which must ever overcome itself.</p>
<p>To be sure, you call it will to procreation, or impulse towards a goal, towards the higher, remoter, more manifold: but all that is one and the same secret.</p>
<p>Rather would I perish than disown this one thing; and verily, where there is perishing and leaf-falling, lo, there does Life sacrifice itself- for power!</p>
<p>That I have to be struggle, and becoming, and purpose, and cross-purpose- ah, he who divines my will, divines well also on what crooked paths it has to tread!</p>
<p>Whatever I create, and however much I love it,- soon must I be adverse to it, and to my love: so wills my will.</p>
<p>And even you, discerning one, are only a path and footstep of my will: verily, my Will to Power walks even on the feet of your Will to Truth!</p>
<p>He certainly did not hit the truth who shot at it the formula: “Will to existence”: that will- does not exist!</p>
<p>For what is not, cannot will; that, however, which is in existence- how could it still strive for existence!</p>
<p>Only where there is life, is there also will: not, however, Will to Life, but- so teach I you- Will to Power!</p>
<p>Much is reckoned higher than life itself by the living one; but out of the very reckoning speaks- the Will to Power!”-</p>
<p>Thus did Life once teach me: and thereby, you wisest ones, do I solve you the riddle of your hearts.</p>
<p>I say to you: good and evil which would be everlasting- it does not exist! Of its own accord must it ever overcome itself anew.</p>
<p>With your values and formulae of good and evil, you exercise power, you valuing ones: and that is your secret love, and the sparkling, trembling, and overflowing of your souls.</p>
<p>But a stronger power grows out of your values, and a new overcoming: by it breaks egg and egg-shell.</p>
<p>And he who has to be a creator in good and evil- verily, he has first to be a destroyer, and break values in pieces.</p>
<p>Thus does the greatest evil pertain to the greatest good: that, however, is the creating good.-</p>
<p>Let us speak thereof, you wisest ones, even though it be bad. To be silent is worse; all suppressed truths become poisonous.</p>
<p>And let everything break up which- can break up by our truths! Many a house is still to be built!</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>strtotime关于在某个日期区间的优化</title>
    <url>/p/1cf0e13d/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>工作中，经常碰到需要判断某个当前时间是否在某个时间区间的情况，一般可通过使用 strtotime 将日期转换成时间戳，然后进行比较，比如：</p>
<figure class="highlight php"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$freedaystart = strtotime($info[<span class="string">&#x27;freedaystart&#x27;</span>].<span class="string">&#x27; 00:00:00&#x27;</span>);</span><br><span class="line">$freedayend = strtotime($info[<span class="string">&#x27;freedayend&#x27;</span>].<span class="string">&#x27; 23:59:59&#x27;</span>);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span>(time() &gt; $freedaystart &amp;&amp;  time() &lt; $freedayend)&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">//...</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>但时分秒拼接上去，感觉不够简洁优雅，可以将结束时间退后一天，时分秒仍默认为0点，像下面这样：</p>
<figure class="highlight php"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$freedaystart = strtotime($info[<span class="string">&#x27;freedaystart&#x27;</span>]);</span><br><span class="line">$freedayend = strtotime(<span class="string">&quot;$info[&#x27;freedayend&#x27;] +1 day&quot;</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>是不是感觉清爽多了，strtotime 还支持其他时间格式，如 <code>strtotime(&quot;$date +1 month +2 day&quot;)</code>等，完整格式列表可参看官网对应页面。</p>
<hr>
<p>经测试，这里 day 的单复数都没有影响，可能是为了更好的兼容，不过为了严谨也为了增强可读性，建议按规范写，该复数的加上复数。</p>
<hr>
<p>日期数据也是可以直接比较的，但需要保持要比较的数据格式完全一致，否则容易出错，因为它们本质上还是当成字符串比较，所以最保险的还是转化成时间戳比较。<br>比如：</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">&#39;2020-04-05&#39; &gt; &#39;2020-03-05&#39;&#x2F;&#x2F;true</span><br><span class="line">&#39;2020-04-05&#39; &gt; &#39;2020-3-5&#39;&#x2F;&#x2F;false</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

    <title>MySQL字符串函数：substring_index()的使用详解</title>
    <url>/p/deda0d61/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="定义"><a href="#定义" class="headerlink" title="定义"></a>定义</h2><p>SUBSTRING_INDEX - 按分隔符截取字符串</p>
<h2 id="语法"><a href="#语法" class="headerlink" title="语法"></a>语法</h2><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">SUBSTRING_INDEX(str, delimiter, count)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>返回一个 str 的子字符串，在 delimiter 出现 count 次的位置截取。<br>如果 count &gt; 0，从则左边数起，且返回位置前的子串；<br>如果 count &lt; 0，从则右边数起，且返回位置后的子串。</p>
<p>delimiter 是大小写敏感，且是多字节安全的。</p>
<h2 id="示例"><a href="#示例" class="headerlink" title="示例"></a>示例</h2><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mysql&gt; SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(&#39;www.mysql.com&#39;, &#39;.&#39;, 2);</span><br><span class="line">        -&gt; &#39;www.mysql&#39;</span><br><span class="line">mysql&gt; SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(&#39;www.mysql.com&#39;, &#39;.&#39;, -2);</span><br><span class="line">        -&gt; &#39;mysql.com&#39;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h2 id="总结"><a href="#总结" class="headerlink" title="总结"></a>总结</h2><p>这个函数很实用，PHP中都没有类似的函数，<br>比如取一个以斜线分割的图片路径的名称，<code>201807/20180731181759_5b603757ea5e4.jpg</code>，这个函数可以一步到位，PHP中则需要explode成数组，然后取最后一个元素。</p>
<p>美中不足的是，我感觉可以再设置个可选参数，就是返回的时候是否保留分隔符，这个当然通过concat连接，但如果能直接返回就更好了。</p>

    <title>【P1C19】The Bite of the Adder</title>
    <url>/p/db77dade/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>One day Zarathustra had fallen asleep under a fig-tree, owing to the heat, with his arm over his face. And there came an adder and bit him in the neck, so that Zarathustra cried with pain. When he had taken his arm from his face he looked at the serpent; and then it recognized the eyes of Zarathustra, wriggled awkwardly, and tried to get away. “Do not go,” said Zarathustra, “as yet have you not received my thanks! you have awakened me in time; my journey is yet long.” “Your journey is short,” said the adder sadly; “my poison is fatal.” Zarathustra smiled. “When ever did a dragon die of a serpent’s poison?”- he said. “But take your poison back! you are not rich enough to give it to me.” Then the adder fell again on his neck, and licked his wound.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>When Zarathustra had told this to his disciples they asked him: “And what, O Zarathustra, is the moral of your story?” And Zarathustra answered them thus:</p>
<p>The destroyer of morality, the good and just call me: my story is immoral.</p>
<p>When, however, you have an enemy, then do not requite him good for evil: for that would shame him. Instead, prove that he did some good for you.</p>
<p>And rather be angry than put to shame! And when you are cursed, I do not like it that you want to bless. Rather curse a little also!</p>
<p>And if you are done a great injustice, then quickly add five small ones. Hideous to behold is he who is obsessed with an injustice.</p>
<p>Did you know this? A shared injustice is half just. And he who can bear it, should take the injustice upon himself!</p>
<p>A small revenge is more human than no revenge at all. And if the punishment is not also a right and an honor to the transgressor, I do not like your punishment.</p>
<p>It is nobler to declare oneself wrong than to prove oneself right, especially when one is right. Only, one must be rich enough to do so.</p>
<p>I do not like your cold justice; out of the eye of your judges there always glances the executioner and his cold steel.</p>
<p>Tell me: where do we find the justice which is love with open eyes? Invent for me then the love which not only bears all punishment, but also all guilt!</p>
<p>Invent for me then the justice which acquits every one, except he who judges!</p>
<p>And would you hear this? To him who would be just from the heart, even lies become a kindness to others.</p>
<p>But how could I be just from the heart! How can I give each his own! Let this be enough for me: I give each my own.</p>
<p>Finally, my brothers, guard against doing wrong to any hermit. How could a hermit forget! How could he requite!</p>
<p>Like a deep well is a hermit. It is easy to throw in a stone: if it sinks to the bottom then tell me, who will bring it out again?</p>
<p>Guard against injuring the hermit! But if you have done so, well then kill him also!Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C1】The Child with the Mirror</title>
    <url>/p/e0dc4cb4/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>After this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains to the solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, waiting like a sower who has scattered his seed. His soul, however, became impatient and full of longing for those whom he loved: because he had still much to give them. For this is hardest of all: to close the open hand out of love, and keep modest as a giver.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his wisdom meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its abundance.</p>
<p>One morning, however, he awoke before the rosy dawn, and having meditated long on his couch, at last spoke thus to his heart:</p>
<p>Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a child come to me, carrying a mirror?</p>
<p>“O Zarathustra”- said the child to me- “look at yourself in the mirror!” But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart throbbed: for not myself did I see therein, but a devil’s grimace and derision.</p>
<p>All too well do I understand the dream’s portent and monition: my doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called wheat!</p>
<p>My enemies have grown powerful and have disfigured the likeness of my doctrine, so that my dearest ones have to blush for the gifts that I gave them.</p>
<p>Lost are my friends; the hour has come for me to seek my lost ones!-</p>
<p>With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like a person in anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a singer whom the spirit inspires. With amazement did his eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a coming bliss overspread his countenance like the rosy dawn.</p>
<p>What has happened to me, my animals?- said Zarathustra. Am I not transformed? has not bliss come to me like a whirlwind?</p>
<p>Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it is still too young- so have patience with it!</p>
<p>Wounded am I by my happiness: all sufferers shall be physicians to me!</p>
<p>To my friends can I again go down, and also to my enemies! Zarathustra can again speak and give, and show his best love to his loved ones!</p>
<p>My impatient love overflows in streams,- down towards sunrise and sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of affliction, rushes my soul into the valleys.</p>
<p>Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too long has solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep silence.</p>
<p>Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a brook from high rocks: downward into the valleys will I hurl my speech.</p>
<p>And let the stream of my love sweep into unfrequented channels! How should a stream not finally find its way to the sea!</p>
<p>There is a lake in me, sequestered and self-sufficing; but the stream of my love bears this along with it, down- to the sea!</p>
<p>New paths do I tread, a new speech comes to me; tired have I becomelike all creators- of the old tongues. No longer will my spirit walk on worn-out soles.</p>
<p>Too slowly runs all speaking for me:- into your chariot, O storm, do I leap! And even you will I whip with my spite!</p>
<p>Like a cry and an huzza will I traverse wide seas, till I find the Blessed isles where my friends sojourn;-</p>
<p>And my enemies amongst them! How I now love every one to whom I may but speak! Even my enemies pertain to my bliss.</p>
<p>And when I want to mount my wildest horse, then does my spear always help me up best: it is my foot’s ever ready servant:-</p>
<p>The spear which I hurl at my enemies! How grateful am I to my enemies that I may at last hurl it!</p>
<p>Too great has been the tension of my cloud: ‘twixt laughters of lightnings will I cast hail-showers into the depths.</p>
<p>Violently will my breast then heave; violently will it blow its storm over the mountains: thus comes its assuagement.</p>
<p>Like a storm comes my happiness, and my freedom! But my enemies shall think that the evil one roars over their heads.</p>
<p>Yes, you also, my friends, will be alarmed by my wild wisdom; and perhaps you will flee therefrom, along with my enemies.</p>
<p>Ah, that I knew how to lure you back with shepherds’ flutes! Ah, that my lioness wisdom would learn to roar softly! And much have we already learned with one another!</p>
<p>My wild wisdom became pregnant on the lonesome mountains; on the rough stones did she bear the youngest of her young.</p>
<p>Now runs she foolishly in the arid wilderness, and seeks and seeks the soft sward- my old, wild wisdom!</p>
<p>On the soft sward of your hearts, my friends!- on your love, would she rather couch her dearest one!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C3】The Compassionate</title>
    <url>/p/efaea7e3/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>My friends, there has arisen a satire on your friend: “Behold Zarathustra! Walks he not amongst us as if amongst animals?”</p>
<p>But it is better said in this wise: “The discerning one walks amongst men as amongst animals.”</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red cheeks.</p>
<p>How has that happened to him? Is it not because he has had to be ashamed too oft?</p>
<p>O my friends! Thus speaks the discerning one: shame, shame, shamethat is the history of man!</p>
<p>And on that account does the noble one enjoin on himself not to abash: bashfulness does he enjoin himself in presence of all sufferers.</p>
<p>I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is in their pity: too destitute are they of bashfulness.</p>
<p>If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so, it is preferably at a distance.</p>
<p>Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being recognized: and thus do I bid you do, my friends!</p>
<p>May my destiny ever lead unafflicted ones like you across my path, and those with whom I may have hope and repast and honey in common!</p>
<p>I have done this and that for the afflicted: but something better did I always seem to do when I had learned to enjoy myself better.</p>
<p>Since humanity came into being, man has enjoyed himself too little: that alone, my brothers, is our original sin!</p>
<p>And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we unlearn best to give pain to others, and to contrive pain.</p>
<p>Therefore do I wash the hand that has helped the sufferer; therefore do I wipe also my soul.</p>
<p>For in seeing the sufferer suffering- thereof was I ashamed on account of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I wound his pride.</p>
<p>Great obligations do not make grateful, but revengeful; and when a small kindness is not forgotten, it becomes a gnawing worm.</p>
<p>“Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!”- thus do I advise those who have naught to give.</p>
<p>I, however, am a giver: willingly do I give as friend to friends. Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for themselves the fruit from my tree: thus does it cause less shame.</p>
<p>Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! it annoys one to give to them, and it annoys one not to give to them.</p>
<p>And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends: the sting of conscience teaches one to sting.</p>
<p>The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Better to have done evilly than to have thought pettily!</p>
<p>To be sure, you say: “The delight in petty evils spares one many a great evil deed.” But here one should not wish to be sparing.</p>
<p>Like a boil is the evil deed: it itches and irritates and breaks forth- it speaks honorably.</p>
<p>“Behold, I am disease,” says the evil deed: that is its honorableness.</p>
<p>But like infection is the petty thought: it creeps and hides, and wants to be nowhere- until the whole body is decayed and withered by the petty infection.</p>
<p>To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would whisper this word in the ear: “Better for you to rear up your devil! Even for you there is still a path to greatness!”-</p>
<p>Ah, my brothers! One knows a little too much about every one! And many a one becomes transparent to us, but still we can by no means penetrate him.</p>
<p>It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult.</p>
<p>And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, but to him who does not concern us at all.</p>
<p>If, however, you have a suffering friend, then be a resting-place for his suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: thus will you serve him best.</p>
<p>And if a friend does you wrong, then say: “I forgive you what you have done to me; that you have done it to yourself, however- how could I forgive that!”</p>
<p>Thus speaks all great love: it overcomes even forgiveness and pity.</p>
<p>One should hold fast one’s heart; for when one lets it go, how quickly does one’s head run away!</p>
<p>Ah, where in the world have there been greater follies than with the pitiful? And what in the world has caused more suffering than the follies of the pitiful?</p>
<p>Woe to all loving ones who have not an elevation which is above their pity!</p>
<p>Thus spoke the devil to me, once on a time: “Even God has his hell: it is his love for man.”</p>
<p>And lately, did I hear him say these words: “God is dead: of his pity for man has God died.”-</p>
<p>So be you warned against pity: from thence there yet comes to men a heavy cloud! I understand weather-signs!</p>
<p>But attend also to this word: All great love is above all its pity: for it seeks- to create what is loved!</p>
<p>“Myself do I offer to my love, and my neighbor as myself”- such is the language of all creators.</p>
<p>All creators, however, are hard.-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C10】The Dance Song</title>
    <url>/p/ccaa3823/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>One evening went Zarathustra and his disciples through the forest; and when he sought for a well, lo, he lighted upon a green meadow peacefully surrounded by trees and bushes, where maidens were dancing together. As soon as the maidens recognized Zarathustra, they ceased dancing; Zarathustra, however, approached them with friendly mien and spoke these words:</p>
<p>Cease not your dancing, you lovely maidens! No game-spoiler has come to you with evil eye, no enemy of maidens.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>God’s advocate am I with the devil: yet he is the spirit of gravity. How could I, you light-footed ones, be hostile to divine dances? Or to maidens’ feet with fine ankles?</p>
<p>To be sure, I am a forest, and a night of dark trees: but he who is not afraid of my darkness, will find banks full of roses under my cypresses.</p>
<p>And even the little God may he find, who is dearest to maidens: beside the well lies he quietly, with closed eyes.</p>
<p>In broad daylight did he fall asleep, the sluggard! Had he perhaps chased butterflies too much?</p>
<p>Upbraid me not, you beautiful dancers, when I chasten the little God somewhat! He will cry, certainly, and weep- but he is laughable even when weeping!</p>
<p>And with tears in his eyes shall he ask you for a dance; and I myself will sing a song to his dance:</p>
<p>A dance-song and satire on the spirit of gravity my supremest, powerfulest devil, who is said to be “lord of the world.”-</p>
<p>And this is the song that Zarathustra sang when Cupid and the maidens danced together:</p>
<p>Of late did I gaze into your eye, O Life! And into the unfathomable did I there seem to sink.</p>
<p>But you pulled me out with a golden angle; derisively did you laugh when I called you unfathomable.</p>
<p>“Such is the language of all fish,” said you; “what they do not fathom is unfathomable.</p>
<p>But changeable am I only, and wild, and altogether a woman, and no virtuous one:</p>
<p>Though I be called by you men the ‘profound one,’ or the ‘faithful one,’ ‘the eternal one,’ ‘the mysterious one.’</p>
<p>But you men endow us always with your own virtues- alas, you virtuous ones!”</p>
<p>Thus did she laugh, the unbelievable one; but never do I believe her and her laughter, when she speaks evil of herself.</p>
<p>And when I talked face to face with my wild Wisdom, she said to me angrily: “You will, you crave, you love; on that account alone do you praise Life!”</p>
<p>Then had I almost answered indignantly and told the truth to the angry one; and one cannot answer more indignantly than when one “tells the truth” to one’s Wisdom.</p>
<p>For thus do things stand with us three. In my heart do I love only Lifeand verily, most when I hate her!</p>
<p>But that I am fond of Wisdom, and often too fond, is because she reminds me very strongly of Life!</p>
<p>She has her eye, her laugh, and even her golden angle-rod: am I responsible for it that both are so alike?</p>
<p>And when once Life asked me: “Who is she then, this Wisdom?”- then said I eagerly: “Ah, yes! Wisdom!</p>
<p>One thirsts for her and is not satisfied, one looks through veils, one grasps through nets.</p>
<p>Is she beautiful? What do I know! But the oldest carps are still lured by her.</p>
<p>Changeable is she, and wayward; often have I seen her bite her lip, and pass the comb against the grain of her hair.</p>
<p>Perhaps she is wicked and false, and altogether a woman; but when she speaks ill of herself, just then does she seduce most.”</p>
<p>When I had said this to Life, then laughed she maliciously, and shut her eyes. “Of whom do you speak?” said she. “Perhaps of me?</p>
<p>And if you were right- is it proper to say that in such wise to my face! But now, pray, speak also of your Wisdom!”</p>
<p>Ah, and now have you again opened your eyes, O beloved Life! And into the unfathomable have I again seemed to sink.Thus sang Zarathustra. But when the dance was over and the maidens had departed, he became sad.</p>
<p>“The sun has been long set,” said he at last, “the meadow is damp, and from the forest comes coolness.</p>
<p>An unknown presence is about me, and gazes thoughtfully. What! you live still, Zarathustra?</p>
<p>Why? Wherefore? Whereby? Where? Where? How? Is it not folly still to live?Ah, my friends; the evening is it which thus interrogates in me. Forgive me my sadness!</p>
<p>Evening has come on: forgive me that evening has come on!”</p>
<p>Thus sang Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P1C4】The Despisers of the Body</title>
    <url>/p/50bd86d4/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>To the despisers of the body I speak my word. I wish them neither to learn afresh, nor teach anew, but only to bid farewell to their own bodies,- and thus become silent.</p>
<p>“Body am I, and soul”- so says the child. And why should one not speak like children?</p>
<p>But the awakened one, the knowing one, says: “Body am I entirely, and nothing more; and soul is only the name of something in the body.”</p>
<p>The body is a great wisdom, a plurality with one sense, a war and a peace, a flock and a shepherd.</p>
<p>An instrument of your body is also your small wisdom, my brother, which you call “mind”- a little instrument and toy of your great wisdom.</p>
<p>“I,” you say, and are proud of that word. But the greater thing- in which you are unwilling to believe- is your body with its great wisdom; that does not say “I,” but does “I.”</p>
<p>What the sense feels, what the mind knows, never has its end in itself. But sense and mind would rather persuade you that they are the end of all things: so vain are they.</p>
<p>Instruments and toys are sense and mind: behind them there is still the Self. The Self seeks with the eyes of the senses, it listens also with the ears of the mind.</p>
<p>Always the Self listens and seeks; it compares, masters, conquers, and destroys. It rules, and is also the mind’s ruler.</p>
<p>Behind your thoughts and feelings, my brother, there is a mighty lord, an unknown sage- it is called Self; it dwells in your body, it is your body.</p>
<p>There is more wisdom in your body than in your best wisdom. And who then knows why your body needs precisely your best wisdom?</p>
<p>Your Self laughs at your mind, and its bold leaps. “What are these leaps and flights of thought to me?” it says to itself. “A detour to my end.</p>
<p>30 I hold the puppet-strings of the mind, and am the prompter of its notions.”</p>
<p>The Self says to the mind: “Feel pain!” Then the mind suffers, and thinks how it may put an end to its suffering- and that is why it is made to think.</p>
<p>The Self says to the mind: “Feel pleasure!” Then the mind is pleased, and thinks how it may be pleased again- and that is why it is made to think.</p>
<p>I want to speak to the despisers of the body. Their contempt is caused by their respect. What is it that created respect and contempt and worth and will?</p>
<p>The creating Self created for itself respect and contempt, it created for itself pleasure and pain. The creative body created the mind as a hand for its will.</p>
<p>Even in your folly and contempt you each serve your Self, you despisers of the body. I tell you, your very Self wants to die, and turns away from life.</p>
<p>No longer can your Self do that which it desires most:- create beyond itself. That is what it desires most; that is its fervent wish.</p>
<p>But it is now too late to do so:- so your Self wishes to perish, you despisers of the body.</p>
<p>To perish- so wishes your Self; and therefore you have become despisers of the body. For you can no longer create beyond yourselves.</p>
<p>And that is why you are angry with life and the earth. An unconscious envy is in the sidelong glance of your contempt.</p>
<p>I do not go your way, you despisers of the body! You are no bridges to the Superman!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C8】The Famous Wise Men</title>
    <url>/p/a0eaddb2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The people have you served and the people’s superstition- not the truth!- all you famous wise ones! And just on that account did they pay you reverence.</p>
<p>And on that account also did they tolerate your unbelief, because it was a pleasantry and a by-path for the people. Thus does the master give free scope to his slaves, and even enjoys their presumptuousness.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>But he who is hated by the people, as the wolf by the dogs- is the free spirit, the enemy of fetters, the non-adorer, the dweller in the woods.</p>
<p>To hunt him out of his lair- that was always called “sense of right” by the people: on him do they still hound their sharpest-toothed dogs.</p>
<p>“For there the truth is, where the people are! Woe, woe to the seeking ones!”- thus has it echoed through all time.</p>
<p>Your people would you justify in their reverence: that called you “Will to Truth,” you famous wise ones!</p>
<p>And your heart has always said to itself: “From the people have I come: from thence came to me also the voice of God.”</p>
<p>Stiff-necked and artful, like the ass, have you always been, as the advocates of the people.</p>
<p>And many a powerful one who wanted to run well with the people, has harnessed in front of his horses- a donkey, a famous wise man.</p>
<p>And now, you famous wise ones, I would have you finally throw off entirely the skin of the lion!</p>
<p>The skin of the beast of prey, the speckled skin, and the dishevelled locks of the investigator, the searcher, and the conqueror!</p>
<p>Ah! for me to learn to believe in your “conscientiousness,” you would first have to break your venerating will.</p>
<p>Conscientious- so call I him who goes into God-forsaken wildernesses, and has broken his venerating heart.</p>
<p>In the yellow sands and burnt by the sun, he doubtless peers thirstily at the isles rich in fountains, where life reposes under shady trees.</p>
<p>But his thirst does not persuade him to become like those comfortable ones: for where there are oases, there are also idols.</p>
<p>Hungry, fierce, lonesome, God-forsaken: so does the lion-will wish itself.</p>
<p>Free from the happiness of slaves, redeemed from deities and adorations, fearless and fear-inspiring, grand and lonesome: so is the will of the conscientious.</p>
<p>In the wilderness have ever dwelt the conscientious, the free spirits, as lords of the wilderness; but in the cities dwell the well-foddered, famous wise ones- the draught-beasts.</p>
<p>For, always do they draw, as asses- the people’s carts!</p>
<p>Not that I on that account upbraid them: but serving ones do they remain, and harnessed ones, even though they glitter in golden harness.</p>
<p>And often have they been good servants and worthy of their hire. For thus says virtue: “If you must be a servant, seek him to whom your service is most useful!</p>
<p>The spirit and virtue of your master shall advance by you being his servant: thus will you yourself advance with his spirit and virtue!”</p>
<p>And verily, you famous wise ones, you servants of the people! You yourselves have advanced with the people’s spirit and virtue- and the people by you! To your honor do I say it!</p>
<p>But the people you remain for me, even with your virtues, the people with purblind eyes- the people who know not what spirit is!</p>
<p>Spirit is life which itself cuts into life: by its own torture does it increase its own knowledge,- did you know that before?</p>
<p>And the spirit’s happiness is this: to be anointed and consecrated with tears as a sacrificial victim,- did you know that before?</p>
<p>And the blindness of the blind one, and his seeking and groping, shall yet testify to the power of the sun into which he has gazed,- did you know that before?</p>
<p>And with mountains shall the discerning one learn to build! It is a small thing for the spirit to remove mountains,- did you know that before?</p>
<p>You know only the sparks of the spirit: but you do not see the anvil which it is, and the cruelty of its hammer!</p>
<p>You know not the spirit’s pride! But still less could you endure the spirit’s humility, should it ever want to speak!</p>
<p>And never yet could you cast your spirit into a pit of snow: you are not hot enough for that! Thus are you unaware, also, of the delight of its coldness.</p>
<p>In all respects, however, you make too familiar with the spirit; and out of wisdom have you often made an alms-house and a hospital for bad poets.</p>
<p>You are not eagles: thus have you never experienced the happiness of the alarm of the spirit. And he who is not a bird should not camp above abysses.</p>
<p>You seem to me lukewarm ones: but coldly flows all deep knowledge. Ice-cold are the innermost wells of the spirit: a refreshment to hot hands and handlers.</p>
<p>Respectable do you there stand, and stiff, and with straight backs, you famous wise ones!- no strong wind or will impels you.</p>
<p>Have you ne’er seen a sail crossing the sea, rounded and inflated, and trembling with the violence of the wind?</p>
<p>Like the sail trembling with the violence of the spirit, does my wisdom cross the sea- my wild wisdom!</p>
<p>But you servants of the people, you famous wise ones- how could you go with me!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P1C12】The Flies in the Market-Place</title>
    <url>/p/88d678d/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Flee, my friend, into your solitude! I see you deafened with the noise of the great men, and stung all over with the stings of the little ones.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Forest and rock know how to be silent with you. Be like the tree which you love, the broad-branched one- silently and attentively it overhangs the sea.</p>
<p>Where solitude ends, there begins the market-place; and where the market-place begins, there begins also the noise of the great actors, and the buzzing of the poison-flies.</p>
<p>In the world even the best things are worthless without those who make a side-show of them: these showmen, the people call great men.</p>
<p>Little do the people understand what is great- that is to say, the creator. But they have a taste for all showmen and actors of great things.</p>
<p>Around the creators of new values revolves the world:- invisibly it revolves. But around the actors revolve the people and the glory: such is the course of things.</p>
<p>The actor has spirit, but little conscience of the spirit. He always believes in that with which he most strongly inspires belief - in himself!</p>
<p>Tomorrow he has a new belief, and the day after, one still newer. Like the people, he has quick perceptions and fickle moods.</p>
<p>To defeat- that means for him: to prove. To drive to frenzy- that means for him: to convince. And blood is to him the best of all arguments.</p>
<p>A truth which glides only into refined ears, he calls falsehood and nothing. He believes only in gods that make a big noise in the world!</p>
<p>Full of clattering fools is the market-place,- and the people glory in their great men! These are for them the masters of the hour.</p>
<p>But the hour presses them; so they press you. And also from you they want Yes or No. Alas! would you set your chair between Pro and Con?</p>
<p>Do not be jealous of those unyielding and impatient men, you lover of truth! Never yet did truth cling to the arm of the unyielding.</p>
<p>On account of those abrupt ones, return into your security: only in the market-place is one assailed by Yes? or No?</p>
<p>Slow is the experience of all deep fountains: long have they to wait until they know what has fallen into their depths.</p>
<p>Far away from the market-place and from fame happens all that is great: far away from the market-place and from fame have always dwelt the creators of new values.</p>
<p>Flee, my friend, into your solitude: I see you stung all over by the poisonous flies. Flee to where a rough, strong breeze blows!</p>
<p>Flee into your solitude! you have lived too closely to the small and the pitiful. Flee from their invisible vengeance! For you they have nothing but vengeance.</p>
<p>No longer raise your arm against them! They are innumerable, and it is not your task to shoo flies.</p>
<p>Innumerable are the small and pitiful ones; and rain-drops and weeds have been the ruin of many a proud structure.</p>
<p>You are not stone; but already have you become hollow from many drops. You will yet break and burst from the many drops.</p>
<p>I see you exhausted by poisonous flies; I see you bleeding and torn at a hundred spots; and your pride refuses even to be angry.</p>
<p>They would have blood from you in all innocence; blood is what bloodless souls crave- and therefore they sting in all innocence.</p>
<p>But you, profound one, you suffer too profoundly even from small wounds; and before you have healed, the same poison-worm crawls over your hand.</p>
<p>You are too proud to kill these gluttons. But take care lest it be your fate to suffer all their poisonous injustice!</p>
<p>They buzz around you also with their praise: obtrusiveness is their praise. They want to be close to your skin and your blood.</p>
<p>They flatter you, as one flatters a God or devil; they whimper before you, as before a God or devil; What does it come to! They are flatterers and whimperers, and nothing more.</p>
<p>Often, also, do they show themselves to you as friendly ones. But that has always been the prudence of cowards. Yes! cowards are wise!</p>
<p>They think much about you with their petty souls- you are always suspect to them! Whatever is much thought about is at last thought suspicious.</p>
<p>They punish you for all your virtues. They pardon you entirely- for your errors.</p>
<p>Because you are gentle and of honest character, you say: “Guiltless are they for their small existence.” But their petty souls think: “Guilty is every great existence.”</p>
<p>Even when you are gentle towards them, they still feel themselves despised by you; and they repay your beneficence with secret maleficence.</p>
<p>Your silent pride is always counter to their taste; they rejoice if once you are humble enough to be vain.</p>
<p>What we recognize in a man, we also irritate in him. Therefore be on your guard against the small ones!</p>
<p>In your presence they feel themselves small, and their baseness gleams and glows against you in invisible vengeance.</p>
<p>You did not see how often they became silent when you approached them, and how their energy left them like the smoke of an waning fire?</p>
<p>Yes, my friend, you are the bad conscience of your neighbors, for they are unworthy of you. Therefore they hate you, and would rather suck your blood.</p>
<p>Your neighbors will always be poisonous flies; what is great in youthat itself must make them more poisonous, and always more fly-like.</p>
<p>Flee, my friend, into your solitude- and there, where a rough strong breeze blows. It is not your lot to shoo flies.-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P1C14】The Friend</title>
    <url>/p/ebb7e67c/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>“There is always one too many about me”- thinks the hermit. “Always one and one- eventually that makes two!”</p>
<p>I and me are always too deeply in conversation: how could I endure it, if there were not a friend?</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>The friend of the hermit is always the third one: the third one is the float which prevents the conversation of the two from sinking into the depth.</p>
<p>Ah! there are too many depths for all hermits. Therefore, do they long so much for a friend and his height.</p>
<p>Our faith in others betrays that we would rather have faith in ourselves. Our longing for a friend is our betrayer.</p>
<p>And often with our love we want merely to overcome envy. And often we attack and make ourselves enemies, to conceal that we are vulnerable.</p>
<p>“Be at least my enemy!”- thus speaks true reverence, which dares not ask for friendship.</p>
<p>If one would have a friend, then must one also be willing to wage war for him: and in order to wage war, one must be capable of being an enemy.</p>
<p>One ought still to honor the enemy in one’s friend. Can you go near to your friend, and not go over to him?</p>
<p>In a friend one shall have one’s best enemy. You shall be closest to him with your heart when you withstand him.</p>
<p>You would wear no raiment before your friend? It is in honor of your friend that you show yourself to him as you are? But he sends you to the devil for that!</p>
<p>He who makes no secret of himself shocks: so much reason have you to fear nakedness! Aye, if you were gods, you might then be ashamed of clothing!</p>
<p>You can not adorn yourself fine enough for your friend; for you shall be to him an arrow and a longing for the Superman.</p>
<p>Did you ever see your friend asleep- and saw how he looks? What is the face of your friend? It is your own face, in a coarse and imperfect mirror.</p>
<p>Did you ever see your friend asleep? were you not shocked that your friend looked like that? O my friend, man is something that must be overcome.</p>
<p>In guessing and keeping silent, the friend shall be a master: you must not want to see everything. Your dreams will tell you what your friend does when awake.</p>
<p>Let your pity be a guess: to know first if your friend wants pity. Perhaps he loves in you the unmoved eye, and the look of eternity.</p>
<p>Let your pity for your friend be hidden under a hard shell; you shall break a tooth on it. Thus it will have delicacy and sweetness.</p>
<p>Are you pure air and solitude and bread and medicine to your friend? Many a one cannot loosen his own chains, but can nevertheless free his friend.</p>
<p>Are you a slave? Then you cannot be a friend. Are you a tyrant? Then you cannot have friends.</p>
<p>Far too long have slave and tyrant been concealed in woman. On that account woman is not yet capable of friendship: she knows only love.</p>
<p>In woman’s love there is injustice and blindness to all she does not love. And even in woman’s conscious love, there is still always attack and lightning and night, along with the light.</p>
<p>As yet woman is not capable of friendship: women are still cats and birds. Or at best, cows.</p>
<p>As yet woman is not capable of friendship. But tell me, you men, who of you is capable of friendship?</p>
<p>Oh! your poverty, you men, and your sparingness of soul! As much as you give to your friend, I will give even to my enemy, and will not become poorer for it.</p>
<p>There is comradeship: may there be friendship!</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P1C22】The Giving Virtue</title>
    <url>/p/6fd217a7/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>1.<br>When Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his heart was attached, the name of which is “The Pied Cow,” many people who called themselves his disciples followed him, and kept him company. Thus they came to a crossroads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now wanted to walk alone; for he was fond of walking alone. His disciples, however, presented him a staff with a golden handle, on which a serpent twined round the sun. Zarathustra rejoiced on account of the staff, and leaned on it; then thus he spoke to his disciples:</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Tell me, pray: how did gold attain the highest value? Because it is uncommon, and useless, and gleaming, and soft in lustre; it always gives itself.</p>
<p>Only as an image of the highest virtue did gold attain the highest value. Golden, gleams the glance of the giver. Golden lustre makes peace between moon and sun.</p>
<p>Uncommon is the highest virtue, and useless, it is gleaming, and soft of lustre: a giving virtue is the highest virtue.</p>
<p>I know you well, my disciples: you strive like me for the giving virtue. What would you have in common with cats and wolves?</p>
<p>You thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves: and so you thirst to amass all riches in your soul.</p>
<p>Your soul strives insatiably for treasures and jewels, because your virtue is insatiable in desiring to give.</p>
<p>You force all things to flow towards you and into you, so that they shall flow back again out of your fountain as the gifts of your love.</p>
<p>Such giving love must become a thief of all values; but I call this selfishness healthy and sacred,.-</p>
<p>There is another selfishness, an all-too-poor and hungry kind, which would always steal- the selfishness of the sick, the sickly selfishness.</p>
<p>With the eye of the thief it looks upon all that is lustrous; with the craving of hunger it measures him who has abundance; and ever does it prowl round the tables of givers.</p>
<p>Sickness speaks in such craving and invisible degeneration; the larcenous craving of this selfishness speaks of a sickly body.</p>
<p>Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of all? Is it not degeneration?- And we always suspect degeneration when the giving soul is lacking.</p>
<p>Upward goes our course from genera on to over-genera. But a horror to us is the degenerate sense, which says: “All for myself.”</p>
<p>Upward soars our sense: thus is it a parable of our body, a parable of an elevation. Such parables of elevations are the names of the virtues.</p>
<p>Thus the body goes through history, a becoming and fighting. And the spirit- what is that to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, its companion and echo.</p>
<p>All names of good and evil are parables; they do not speak out, they only hint. A fool is he who seeks knowledge from them!</p>
<p>Take heed, my brothers, of every hour when your spirit would speak in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.</p>
<p>Your body is then elevated and raised up; with its rapture it delights the spirit, so that it becomes creator, and valuer, and lover, and benefactor of all.</p>
<p>When your heart overflows broad and full like the river, a blessing and a danger to those on the banks: there is the origin of your virtue.</p>
<p>When you are exalted above praise and blame, and your will wants to command all things, as a lover’s will: there is the origin of your virtue.</p>
<p>When you despise pleasant things, and the soft couch, and cannot couch far enough from the soft: there is the origin of your virtue.</p>
<p>When you will with one will, and when the end of all need is necessary to you: there is the origin of your virtue.</p>
<p>It is a new good and evil! a new deep murmuring, and the voice of a new fountain!</p>
<p>This new virtue is power; it is a ruling thought, and around it a discerning soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of knowledge around it.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Here Zarathustra paused awhile, and looked lovingly on his disciples. Then he continued to speak thus- and his voice had changed:</p>
<p>Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your virtue! Let your giving love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the earth! Thus I pray and beseech you.</p>
<p>Do not let it fly away from the earthly and beat its wings against eternal walls! Ah, there has always been so much virtue that has flown away!</p>
<p>Lead, like me, the virtue that has flown away back to the earth- yes, back to body and life: that it may give a meaning to the earth, a human meaning!</p>
<p>A hundred times before spirit as well as virtue has flown away and blundered. Alas! all this delusion and blundering still dwells in our body: it has there become body and will.</p>
<p>A hundred times before has spirit as well as virtue tried and erred. Yes, man has been an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error has become embodied in us!</p>
<p>Not only the rationality of millennia- also their madness, breaks out in us. It is dangerous to be an heir.</p>
<p>Still we fight step by step with the giant Chance, and hitherto over all mankind has ruled nonsense, the lack-of-sense.</p>
<p>Let your spirit and your virtue serve the sense of the earth, my brothers: let the value of all things be determined anew by you! Therefore you shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!</p>
<p>With knowledge, the body purifies itself; experimenting with knowledge, it exalts itself; to the knowledgeable all impulses are sacred; to the exalted, the soul becomes joyful.</p>
<p>Physician, heal thyself: then you will also heal your patient. Let it be his best cure to see with his eyes the man who heals himself.</p>
<p>There are a thousand paths which have never yet been trodden; a thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Man and man’s world is still unexhausted and undiscovered.</p>
<p>Awake and listen, you that are lonely! From the future come winds with stealthy wings, and to subtle ears good tidings are proclaimed.</p>
<p>You that are lonely today, you that withdraw, you shall one day be a people: out of you, who have chosen yourselves, shall arise a chosen people:- and out of them, the Superman.</p>
<p>The earth shall become a place of healing! And there already is a new fragrance surrounding it, a salvation-bringing fragrance- and a new hope!</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he paused, like one who had not yet said his last word; and long did he balance the staff doubtfully in his hand. At last he spoke thus- and his voice had changed:</p>
<p>I now go alone, my disciples! You too go now, alone! Thus I want it.</p>
<p>I advise you: depart from me, and guard yourselves against Zarathustra! And better still: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he has deceived you.</p>
<p>The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies, but also to hate his friends.</p>
<p>One requites a teacher badly if one remains merely a student. And why will you not pluck at my wreath?</p>
<p>You venerate me; but what if your veneration should some day collapse? Beware lest a statue crush you!</p>
<p>You say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra! You are my believers: but what matters all believers!</p>
<p>You had not yet sought yourselves: then you found me. So do all believers; thus all belief matters so little.</p>
<p>Now I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have all denied me will I return to you.</p>
<p>With other eyes, my brothers, shall I then seek my lost ones; with another love shall I then love you.</p>
<p>And once again you shall become friends to me, and children of one hope: then I will be with you for the third time, to celebrate the great noontide with you.</p>
<p>And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course between animal and Superman, and celebrates his advance to the evening as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.</p>
<p>Then will the down-goer bless himself, for being an over-goer; and the sun of his knowledge will be at noontide.</p>
<p>“Dead are all Gods: now we want the Superman to live.”- Let this be our final will at the great noontide!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C11】The Grave Song</title>
    <url>/p/b144eab0/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>“Yonder is the grave-island, the silent isle; yonder also are the graves of my youth. There will I carry an evergreen wreath of life.”</p>
<p>Resolving thus in my heart, did I sail o’er the sea.-</p>
<p>Oh, you sights and scenes of my youth! Oh, all you gleams of love, you divine fleeting gleams! How could you perish so soon for me! I think of you to-day as my dead ones.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>From you, my dearest dead ones, comes to me a sweet savor, heartopening and melting. It convulses and opens the heart of the lone seafarer.</p>
<p>Still am I the richest and most to be envied- I, the most lonesome one! For I have possessed you, and you possess me still. Tell me: to whom has there ever fallen such rosy apples from the tree as have fallen to me?</p>
<p>Still am I your love’s heir and heritage, blooming to your memory with many-hued, wild-growing virtues, O you dearest ones!</p>
<p>Ah, we were made to remain near to each other, you kindly strange marvels; and not like timid birds did you come to me and my longingno, but as trusting ones to a trusting one!</p>
<p>Yes, made for faithfulness, like me, and for fond eternities, must I now name you by your faithlessness, you divine glances and fleeting gleams: no other name have I yet learnt.</p>
<p>Too early did you die for me, you fugitives. Yet did you not flee from me, nor did I flee from you: innocent are we to each other in our faithlessness.</p>
<p>To kill me, did they strangle you, you singing birds of my hopes! Yes, at you, you dearest ones, did malice ever shoot its arrows- to hit my heart!</p>
<p>And they hit it! Because you were always my dearest, my possession and my possessedness: on that account had you to die young, and far too early!</p>
<p>At my most vulnerable point did they shoot the arrow- namely, at you, whose skin is like down- or more like the smile that dies at a glance!</p>
<p>But this word will I say to my enemies: What is all manslaughter in comparison with what you have done to me!</p>
<p>Worse evil did you do to me than all manslaughter; the irretrievable did you take from me:- thus do I speak to you, my enemies!</p>
<p>Slew you not my youth’s visions and dearest marvels! My playmates took you from me, the blessed spirits! To their memory do I deposit this wreath and this curse.</p>
<p>This curse upon you, my enemies! Have you not made my eternal short, as a tone dies away in a cold night! Scarcely, as the twinkle of divine eyes, did it come to me- as a fleeting gleam!</p>
<p>Thus spoke once in a happy hour my purity: “Divine shall everything be to me.”</p>
<p>Then did you haunt me with foul phantoms; ah, where has that happy hour now fled!</p>
<p>“All days shall be sacred to me”- so spoke once the wisdom of my youth: verily, the language of a joyous wisdom!</p>
<p>But then did you enemies steal my nights, and sold them to sleepless torture: ah, where has that joyous wisdom now fled?</p>
<p>Once did I long for happy auspices: then did you lead an owl-monster across my path, an adverse sign. Ah, where did my tender longing then flee?</p>
<p>All loathing did I once vow to renounce: then did you change my nigh ones and nearest ones into ulcerations. Ah, where did my noblest vow then flee?</p>
<p>As a blind one did I once walk in blessed ways: then did you cast filth on the blind one’s course: and now is he disgusted with the old footpath.</p>
<p>And when I performed my hardest task, and celebrated the triumph of my victories, then did you make those who loved me call out that I then grieved them most.</p>
<p>It was always your doing: you embittered to me my best honey, and the diligence of my best bees.</p>
<p>To my charity have you ever sent the most impudent beggars; around my sympathy have you ever crowded the incurably shameless. Thus have you wounded the faith of my virtue.</p>
<p>And when I offered my holiest as a sacrifice, immediately did your “piety” put its fatter gifts beside it: so that my holiest suffocated in the fumes of your fat.</p>
<p>And once did I want to dance as I had never yet danced: beyond all heavens did I want to dance. Then did you seduce my favorite minstrel.</p>
<p>And now has he struck up an awful, melancholy air; alas, he tooted as a mournful horn to my ear!</p>
<p>Murderous minstrel, instrument of evil, most innocent instrument! Already did I stand prepared for the best dance: then did you kill my rapture with your tones!</p>
<p>Only in the dance do I know how to speak the parable of the highest things:- and now has my grandest parable remained unspoken in my limbs!</p>
<p>Unspoken and unrealised has my highest hope remained! And there have perished for me all the visions and consolations of my youth!</p>
<p>How did I ever bear it? How did I survive and overcome such wounds? How did my soul rise again out of those sepulchres?</p>
<p>Yes, something invulnerable, unburiable is with me, something that would rend rocks asunder: it is called my Will. Silently does it proceed, and unchanged throughout the years.</p>
<p>Its course will it go upon my feet, my old Will; hard of heart is its nature and invulnerable.</p>
<p>Invulnerable am I only in my heel. Ever live you there, and are like yourself, you most patient one! Ever have you burst all shackles of the tomb!</p>
<p>In you still lives also the unrealisedness of my youth; and as life and youth sit you here hopeful on the yellow ruins of graves.</p>
<p>Yes, you are still for me the demolisher of all graves: Hail to you, my Will! And only where there are graves are there resurrections.-</p>
<p>Thus sang Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C14】The Land of Culture</title>
    <url>/p/b8478e7/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Too far did I fly into the future: a horror seized upon me.</p>
<p>And when I looked around me, behold, there time was my sole contemporary.</p>
<p>Then did I fly backwards, homewards- and always faster. Thus did I come to you: you present-day men, and into the land of culture.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>For the first time brought I an eye to see you, and good desire: verily, with longing in my heart did I come.</p>
<p>But how did it turn out with me? Although so alarmed- I had yet to laugh! Never did my eye see anything so motley-colored!</p>
<p>I laughed and laughed, while my foot still trembled, and my heart as well. “Here , is the home of all the paint-pots,”- said I.</p>
<p>With fifty patches painted on faces and limbs- so sat you there to my astonishment, you present-day men!</p>
<p>And with fifty mirrors around you, which flattered your play of colors, and repeated it!</p>
<p>You could wear no better masks, you present-day men, than your own faces! Who could- recognize you!</p>
<p>Written all over with the characters of the past, and these characters also pencilled over with new characters- thus have you concealed yourselves well from all decipherers!</p>
<p>And though one be a trier of the reins, who still believes that you have reins! Out of colors you seem to be baked, and out of glued scraps.</p>
<p>All times and peoples gaze divers-colored out of your veils; all customs and beliefs speak divers-colored out of your gestures.</p>
<p>He who would strip you of veils and wrappers, and paints and gestures, would just have enough left to scare the crows.</p>
<p>I myself am the scared crow that once saw you naked, and without paint; and I flew away when the skeleton ogled at me.</p>
<p>Rather would I be a day-laborer in the under-world, and among the shades of the by-gone!- Fatter and fuller than you, are the underworldlings!</p>
<p>This, yes this, is bitterness to my bowels, that I can neither endure you naked nor clothed, you present-day men!</p>
<p>All that is unhomelike in the future, and whatever makes strayed birds shiver, is verily more homelike and familiar than your “reality.”</p>
<p>For thus speak you: “Real are we wholly, and without faith and superstition”: thus do you plume yourselves- alas! even without plumes!</p>
<p>Indeed, how would you be able to believe, you divers-colored ones!you who are pictures of all that has ever been believed!</p>
<p>Perambulating refutations are you, of belief itself, and a dislocation of all thought. Untrustworthy ones: thus do I call you, you real ones!</p>
<p>All periods prate against one another in your spirits; and the dreams and pratings of all periods were even realer than your awakeness!</p>
<p>Unfruitful are you: therefore do you lack belief. But he who had to create, had always his presaging dreams and astral premonitions- and believed in believing!-</p>
<p>Half-open doors are you, at which grave-diggers wait. And this is your reality: “Everything deserves to perish.”</p>
<p>Alas, how you stand there before me, you unfruitful ones; how lean your ribs! And many of you surely have had knowledge thereof.</p>
<p>Many a one has said: “There has surely a God filched something from me secretly whilst I slept? enough to make a girl for himself therefrom!</p>
<p>“Amazing is the poverty of my ribs!” thus has spoken many a present-day man.</p>
<p>Yes, you are laughable to me, you present-day men! And especially when you marvel at yourselves!</p>
<p>And woe to me if I could not laugh at your marvelling, and had to swallow all that is repugnant in your platters!</p>
<p>As it is, however, I will make lighter of you, since I have to carry what is heavy; and what matter if beetles and May-bugs also alight on my load!</p>
<p>It shall not on that account become heavier to me! And not from you, you present-day men, shall my great weariness arise.-</p>
<p>Ah, where shall I now ascend with my longing! From all mountains do I look out for fatherlands and motherlands.</p>
<p>But a home have I found nowhere: unsettled am I in all cities, and decamping at all gates.</p>
<p>Alien to me, and a mockery, are the present-day men, to whom of late my heart impelled me; and exiled am I from fatherlands and motherlands.</p>
<p>Thus do I love only my children’s land, the undiscovered in the remotest sea: for it do I bid my sails search and search.</p>
<p>To my children will I make amends for being the child of my fathers: and to all the future- for this present-day!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P1C11】The New Idol</title>
    <url>/p/265c1246/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Somewhere there are still peoples and herds, but not with us, my brothers: here there are states.</p>
<p>A state? What is that? Well! open now your ears to me, for now I will speak to you about the death of peoples.</p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>State is the name of the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly it lies; and this lie slips from its mouth: “I, the state, am the people.”</p>
<p>It is a lie! It was creators who created peoples, and hung a faith and a love over them: thus they served life.</p>
<p>Destroyers are they who lay snares for the many, and call it state: they hang a sword and a hundred cravings over them.</p>
<p>Where there are still peoples, the state is not understood, and is hated as the evil eye, and as sin against laws and customs.</p>
<p>This sign I give to you: every people speaks its own language of good and evil, which its neighbor does not understand. It has created its own language of laws and customs.</p>
<p>But the state lies in all the tongues of good and evil; and whatever it says it lies; and whatever it has it has stolen.</p>
<p>Everything in it is false; it bites with stolen teeth, and bites often. It is false down to its bowels.</p>
<p>Confusion of tongues of good and evil; this sign I give you as the sign of the state. This sign points to the will to death! it points to the preachers of death!</p>
<p>All too many are born: for the superfluous the state was created!</p>
<p>See how it entices them to it, the all-too-many! How it swallows and chews and rechews them!</p>
<p>“On earth there is nothing greater than I: I am the governing hand of God.”- thus roars the monster. And not only the long-eared and shortsighted fall upon their knees!</p>
<p>Ah! even in your ears, you great souls, it whispers its gloomy lies! Ah! it finds out the rich hearts which willingly squander themselves!</p>
<p>Yes, it finds you too, you conquerors of the old God! You became weary of conflict, and now your weariness serves the new idol!</p>
<p>It would set up heroes and honorable ones around it, the new idol! Gladly it basks in the sunshine of good consciences,- the cold monster!</p>
<p>It will give everything to you, if you worship it, the new idol: thus it buys the lustre of your virtue, and the glance of your proud eyes.</p>
<p>Through you it seeks to seduce the all-too-many! Yes, a hellish artifice has been created here, a death-horse jingling with the trappings of divine honors!</p>
<p>Yes, a dying for many has been created here, which glorifies itself as life: verily, a great service to all preachers of death!</p>
<p>The state, I call it, where all drink poison, the good and the bad: the state, where all lose themselves, the good and the bad: the state, where the slow suicide of all- is called “life.”</p>
<p>Behold the superfluous! They steal the works of the creators and the treasures of the wise. Education, they call their theft- and everything becomes sickness and trouble to them!</p>
<p>Behold the superfluous! They are always sick; they vomit their bile and call it a newspaper. They devour each other and cannot even digest themselves.</p>
<p>Behold the superfluous! They acquire wealth and become the poorer for it. They seek power, and the lever of power, much money- these impotent ones!</p>
<p>See them clamber, these nimble apes! They clamber over one another, and thus pull each other into the mud and the abyss.</p>
<p>They all strive for the throne: this is their madness- as if happiness sat on the throne! Often filth sits on the throne.- and often also the throne on filth.</p>
<p>Madmen they all seem to me, and clambering apes, and too eager. Foul smells their idol to me, the cold monster: foul they all smell to me, these idolaters.</p>
<p>My brothers, will you suffocate in the fumes of their maws and appetites! Better to break the windows and jump into the open air!</p>
<p>Escape from their foul stench! Escape from the idolatry of the superfluous!</p>
<p>Escape from their foul stench! Escape from the steam of these human sacrifices!</p>
<p>The earth is yet free for great souls. There are still many empty sites for the lonesome and the twosome, surrounded by the fragrance of tranquil seas.</p>
<p>A free life is yet possible for great souls. He who possesses little is that much less possessed: blessed be a little poverty!</p>
<p>There, where the state ends- there only begins the man who is not superfluous: there begins the song of the necessary, the single and irreplaceable melody.</p>
<p>There, where the state ends- look there, my brothers! Do you not see it, the rainbow and the bridges of the Superman?</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C9】The Night Song</title>
    <url>/p/b1acfdd4/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>‘TIS night: now do all gushing fountains speak louder. And my soul also is a gushing fountain.</p>
<p>‘Tis night: now only do all songs of the loving ones awake. And my soul also is the song of a loving one.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Something unappeased, unappeasable, is within me; it longs to find expression. A craving for love is within me, which speaks itself the language of love.</p>
<p>Light am I: ah, that I were night! But it is my lonesomeness to be begirt with light!</p>
<p>Ah, that I were dark and nightly! How would I suck at the breasts of light!</p>
<p>And you yourselves would I bless, you twinkling starlets and glowworms aloft!- and would rejoice in the gifts of your light.</p>
<p>But I live in my own light, I drink again into myself the flames that break forth from me.</p>
<p>I know not the happiness of the receiver; and oft have I dreamt that stealing must be more blessed than receiving.</p>
<p>It is my poverty that my hand never ceases giving; it is my envy that I see waiting eyes and the brightened nights of longing.</p>
<p>Oh, the misery of all givers! Oh, the darkening of my sun! Oh, the craving to crave! Oh, the violent hunger in satiety!</p>
<p>They take from me: but do I yet touch their soul? There is a gap ‘twixt giving and receiving; and the small gap has finally to be bridged over.</p>
<p>A hunger arises out of my beauty: I should like to injure those I illumine; I should like to rob those I have gifted:- thus do I hunger for wickedness.</p>
<p>Withdrawing my hand when another hand already stretches out to it; hesitating like the cascade, which hesitates even in its leap:- thus do I hunger for wickedness!</p>
<p>Such revenge does my abundance think of such mischief wells out of my lonesomeness.</p>
<p>My happiness in giving died in giving; my virtue became weary of itself by its abundance!</p>
<p>He who ever gives is in danger of losing his shame; to him who ever dispenses, the hand and heart become callous by very dispensing.</p>
<p>My eye no longer overflows for the shame of suppliants; my hand has become too hard for the trembling of filled hands.</p>
<p>Whence have gone the tears of my eye, and the down of my heart? Oh, the lonesomeness of all givers! Oh, the silence of all shining ones!</p>
<p>Many suns circle in desert space: to all that is dark do they speak with their light- but to me they are silent.</p>
<p>Oh, this is the hostility of light to the shining one: unpityingly does it pursue its course.</p>
<p>Unfair to the shining one in its innermost heart, cold to the suns:- thus travels every sun.</p>
<p>Like a storm do the suns pursue their courses: that is their travelling. Their inexorable will do they follow: that is their coldness.</p>
<p>Oh, you only is it, you dark, nightly ones, that extract warmth from the shining ones! Oh, you only drink milk and refreshment from the light’s udders!</p>
<p>Ah, there is ice around me; my hand burns with the iciness! Ah, there is thirst in me; it pants after your thirst!</p>
<p>‘Tis night: alas, that I have to be light! And thirst for the nightly! And lonesomeness!</p>
<p>‘Tis night: now do my longing break forth in me as a fountain,- for speech do I long.</p>
<p>‘Tis night: now do all gushing fountains speak louder. And my soul also is a gushing fountain.</p>
<p>‘Tis night: now do all songs of loving ones awake. And my soul also is the song of a loving one.-</p>
<p>Thus sang Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P1C6】The Pale Criminal</title>
    <url>/p/dfd4a9fc/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>YOU do not want to kill, you judges and executioners, until the animal has bowed its head? Behold, the pale criminal has bowed his head: out of his eye speaks the great contempt.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>“My ego is something that shall be overcome: my ego is to me the great contempt of man”: so speaks it out of that eye.</p>
<p>When he judged himself- that was his supreme moment; let not the exalted one return again to his baseness!</p>
<p>There is no salvation for the man who thus suffers from himself, unless it be speedy death.</p>
<p>Your killing, you judges, shall be pity, and not revenge; and as you kill, be sure that you yourselves affirm life!</p>
<p>It is not enough that you should reconcile with the man whom you kill. Let your sorrow be love of the Superman: thus you will justify your own survival!</p>
<p>“Enemy” you shall say, but not “villain,” “invalid” you shall say, but not “wretch,” “fool” you shall say, but not “sinner.”</p>
<p>And you, red judge, if you would confess to all you have done in thought, then everyone would cry: “Away with this filth and this poisonous snake!”</p>
<p>But the thought is one thing, the deed another, and the idea of the deed still another. The wheel of causality does not roll between them.</p>
<p>An idea made this pale man pale. He was equal to his deed when he did it, but the idea of it, he could not endure when it was done.</p>
<p>Always he now saw himself as the doer of one deed. Madness, I call this: the exception reversed itself to the rule in him.</p>
<p>The streak of chalk bewitches the hen; the stroke he struck stopped his weak reason. Madness after the deed, I call this.</p>
<p>34 Hearken, you judges! There is another madness besides, and it is before the deed. Ah! you have not yet crept deep enough into this soul!</p>
<p>Thus speaks the red judge: “Why did this criminal commit murder? He meant to rob.” I tell you, however, that his soul wanted blood, not robbery: he thirsted for the bliss of the knife!</p>
<p>But his weak reason did not understand this madness, and it persuaded him: “What matters blood!” it said; “don’t you want, at least, to rob? Or take revenge?”</p>
<p>And he listened to his weak reason: like lead its words laid upon himtherefore he robbed when he murdered. He did not want to be ashamed of his madness.</p>
<p>And now the lead of his guilt lies upon him, and once more his weak reason is so numb, so paralyzed, so dull.</p>
<p>If only he could only shake his head, then his burden would roll off; but who can shake that head?</p>
<p>What is this man? A mass of diseases that reach out into the world through his spirit; there they want to catch their prey.</p>
<p>What is this man? A coil of wild snakes that are seldom at peace among themselves- so they go forth separately and seek their prey in the world.</p>
<p>Look at that poor body! What it suffered and craved, the poor soul interpreted to itself- it interpreted it as murderous desire, and eagerness for the bliss of the knife.</p>
<p>The man who turns sick today, is overcome by the evil which is evil today: he seeks to cause pain with whatever causes him pain. But there have been other ages, and another evil and good.</p>
<p>Once doubt was evil, and the will to Self. Then the invalids became heretics or witches; as heretics or witches they suffered, and sought to cause suffering.</p>
<p>But this will not enter your ears; it hurts your good people, you tell me. But what matter your good people to me!</p>
<p>Much about your good people cause me disgust, and verily, not their evil. I wish that they had a madness by which they might perish, like this pale criminal!</p>
<p>I wish that their madness were called truth, or fidelity, or justice: but they have their virtue in order to live long, and in miserable selfcomplacency.</p>
<p>I am a railing beside the torrent; whoever is able to grasp me may grasp me! Your crutch, however, I am not.-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P1C9】The Preachers of Death</title>
    <url>/p/4442ec63/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>There are preachers of death: and the earth is full of those to whom renunciation of life must be preached.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>The earth is full of the superfluous; life is marred by the all-too-many. May they be tempted out of this life by the “life eternal”!</p>
<p>“The yellow ones”: so are called the preachers of death, or “the black ones.” But I will show them to you in still other colors.</p>
<p>There are the terrible ones who carry about in themselves the beast of prey, and have no choice except lusts or self-laceration. And even their lusts are self-laceration.</p>
<p>They have not yet become men, those terrible ones: may they preach renunciation of life, and pass away themselves!</p>
<p>There are the spiritually consumptive ones: hardly are they born when they begin to die, and long for doctrines of weariness and renunciation.</p>
<p>They would rather be dead, and we should welcome their wish! Let us beware of awakening those dead ones, and of damaging those living coffins!</p>
<p>They meet an invalid, or an old man, or a corpse- and immediately they say: “Life is refuted!”</p>
<p>But only they are refuted, and their eye, which sees only one facet of existence.</p>
<p>Shrouded in thick melancholy, and eager for the little casualties that bring death: thus do they wait, and clench their teeth.</p>
<p>Or else, they grasp at sweetmeats while mocking their childishness: they cling to their straw of life, and mock at their clinging.</p>
<p>Their wisdom speaks thus: “He who remains alive is a fool; but we are all such fools! And that is the most foolish thing in life!”</p>
<p>“Life is only suffering”: say others, and do not lie. Then see to it that you cease! See to it that the life which is only suffering ceases!</p>
<p>And let this be the teaching of your virtue: “Thou shalt kill thyself! thou shalt steal away from thy life!”-</p>
<p>“Lust is sin,”- so say some who preach death- “let us go apart and beget no children!”</p>
<p>“Giving birth is troublesome,”- say others- “why still give birth? One bears only unfortunates!” And they also are preachers of death.</p>
<p>“Pity is necessary,”- so says a third party. “Take what I have! Take what I am! So much less does life bind me!”</p>
<p>If they were overflowing with pity, they would make their neighbors sick of life. To be evil- that would be their true goodness.</p>
<p>But they want to be rid of life; what do they care if they bind others tighter with their chains and gifts!-</p>
<p>And you also, to whom life is unending work and dissatisfaction, are you not very tired of life? Are you not very ripe for the sermon of death?</p>
<p>All you to whom unending work is dear, and all that is quick, new, and strange- you endure yourselves badly; your diligence is escape, and the will to forget yourself.</p>
<p>If you believed more in life, then would you fling yourselves less to the moment. But you do not have enough capacity for waiting- or even for idling!</p>
<p>Everywhere resounds the voices of those who preach death; and the earth is full of those to whom death must be preached.</p>
<p>Or “life eternal”; it is all the same to me- if only they pass away quickly!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C4】The Priests</title>
    <url>/p/59a87ff0/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>And one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spoke these words to them:</p>
<p>“Here are priests: but although they are my enemies, pass them quietly and with sleeping swords!</p>
<p>Even among them there are heroes; many of them have suffered too much:- so they want to make others suffer.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than their meekness. And readily does he soil himself who touches them.</p>
<p>But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see my blood honored in theirs.”-</p>
<p>And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; but not long had he struggled with the pain, when he began to speak thus:</p>
<p>It moves my heart for those priests. They also go against my taste; but that is the small matter to me, since I am among men.</p>
<p>But I suffer and have suffered with them: prisoners are they to me, and stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put them in fetters:-</p>
<p>In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some one would save them from their Saviour!</p>
<p>On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea tossed them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster!</p>
<p>False values and fatuous words: these are the worst monsters for mortals- long slumbers and waits the fate that is in them.</p>
<p>But at last it comes and awakes and devours and engulfs whatever has built tabernacles upon it.</p>
<p>Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have built themselves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling caves!</p>
<p>Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul- may not fly aloft to its height!</p>
<p>But so enjoins their belief: “On your knees, up the stair, you sinners!”</p>
<p>Rather would I see a shameless one than the distorted eyes of their shame and devotion!</p>
<p>Who created for themselves such caves and penitence-stairs? Was it not those who sought to conceal themselves, and were ashamed under the clear sky?</p>
<p>And only when the clear sky looks again through ruined roofs, and down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls- will I again turn my heart to the seats of this God.</p>
<p>They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and verily, there was much hero-spirit in their worship!</p>
<p>And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than by nailing men to the cross!</p>
<p>As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their corpses; even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavor of charnel-houses.</p>
<p>And he who lives near to them lives near to black pools, wherein the toad sings his song with sweet gravity.</p>
<p>Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in their Saviour: more! like saved ones would his disciples have to appear to me!</p>
<p>Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should preach penitence. But whom would that disguised affliction convince!</p>
<p>Their saviours themselves came not from freedom and freedom’s seventh heaven! they themselves never trod the carpets of knowledge!</p>
<p>Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into every defect had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which they called God.</p>
<p>In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they swelled and o’erswelled with pity, there always floated to the surface a great folly.</p>
<p>Eagerly and with shouts drove they their flock over their foot-bridge; as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! those shepherds also were still of the flock!</p>
<p>Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, my brothers, what small domains have even the most spacious souls hitherto been!</p>
<p>Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and their folly taught that truth is proved by blood.</p>
<p>But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood taints the purest teaching, and turns it into delusion and hatred of heart.</p>
<p>And when a person goes through fire for his teaching- what does that prove! It is more, verily, when out of one’s own burning comes one’s own teaching!</p>
<p>Sultry heart and cold head; where these meet, there arises the blusterer, the “Saviour.”</p>
<p>Greater ones, verily, have there been, and higher-born ones, than those whom the people call saviours, those rapturous blusterers!</p>
<p>And by still greater ones than any of the saviours must you be saved, my brothers, if you would find the way to freedom!</p>
<p>Never yet has there been a Superman. Naked have I seen both of them, the greatest man and the small man:-</p>
<p>All-too-similar are they still to each other. Even the greatest found Iall-too-human!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C6】The Rabble</title>
    <url>/p/ea6aa035/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Life is a well of delight; but where the rabble also drink, there all fountains are poisoned.</p>
<p>To everything cleanly am I well disposed; but I hate to see the grinning mouths and the thirst of the unclean.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>They cast their eye down into the fountain: and now glances up to me their odious smile out of the fountain.</p>
<p>The holy water have they poisoned with their lustfulness; and when they called their filthy dreams delight, then poisoned they also the words.</p>
<p>Indignant becomes the flame when they put their damp hearts to the fire; the spirit itself bubbles and smokes when the rabble approach the fire.</p>
<p>Mawkish and over-mellow becomes the fruit in their hands: unsteady, and withered at the top, does their look make the fruit-tree.</p>
<p>And many a one who has turned away from life, has only turned away from the rabble: he hated to share with them fountain, flame, and fruit.</p>
<p>And many a one who has gone into the wilderness and suffered thirst with beasts of prey, disliked only to sit at the cistern with filthy cameldrivers.</p>
<p>And many a one who has come along as a destroyer, and as a hailstorm to all cornfields, wanted merely to put his foot into the jaws of the rabble, and thus stop their throat.</p>
<p>And it is not the mouthful which has most choked me, to know that life itself requires enmity and death and torture-crosses:-</p>
<p>But I asked once, and suffocated almost with my question: What? Is the rabble also necessary for life?</p>
<p>Are poisoned fountains necessary, and stinking fires, and filthy dreams, and maggots in the bread of life?</p>
<p>Not my hatred, but my loathing, gnawed hungrily at my life! Ah, ofttimes became I weary of spirit, when I found even the rabble spiritual!</p>
<p>And on the rulers turned I my back, when I saw what they now call ruling: to traffic and bargain for power- with the rabble!</p>
<p>Amongst peoples of a strange language did I dwell, with stopped ears: so that the language of their trafficking might remain strange to me, and their bargaining for power.</p>
<p>And holding my nose, I went morosely through all yesterdays and todays: verily, badly smell all yesterdays and todays of the scribbling rabble!</p>
<p>Like a cripple become deaf, and blind, and dumb- thus have I lived long; that I might not live with the power-rabble, the scribe-rabble, and the pleasure-rabble.</p>
<p>Toilsomely did my spirit mount stairs, and cautiously; alms of delight were its refreshment; on the staff did life creep along with the blind one.</p>
<p>What has happened to me? How have I freed myself from loathing? Who has rejuvenated my eye? How have I flown to the height where no rabble any longer sit at the wells?</p>
<p>Did my loathing itself create for me wings and fountain-divining powers? to the loftiest height had I to fly, to find again the well of delight!</p>
<p>Oh, I have found it, my brothers! Here on the loftiest height bubbles up for me the well of delight! And there is a life at whose waters none of the rabble drink with me!</p>
<p>Almost too violently do you flow for me, you fountain of delight! And often emptiest you the goblet again, in wanting to fill it!</p>
<p>And yet must I learn to approach you more modestly: far too violently does my heart still flow towards you:-</p>
<p>My heart on which my summer burns, my short, hot, melancholy, over-happy summer: how my summer heart longs for your coolness!</p>
<p>Past, the lingering distress of my spring! Past, the wickedness of my snowflakes in June! Summer have I become entirely, and summernoontide!</p>
<p>A summer on the loftiest height, with cold fountains and blissful stillness: oh, come, my friends, that the stillness may become more blissful!</p>
<p>For this is our height and our home: too high and steep do we here dwell for all uncleanly ones and their thirst.</p>
<p>Cast but your pure eyes into the well of my delight, my friends! How could it become turbid thereby! It shall laugh back to you with its purity.</p>
<p>On the tree of the future build we our nest; eagles shall bring us lone ones food in their beaks!</p>
<p>No food of which the impure could be fellow-partakers! Fire, would they think they devoured, and burn their mouths!</p>
<p>No abodes do we here keep ready for the impure! An ice-cave to their bodies would our happiness be, and to their spirits!</p>
<p>And as strong winds will we live above them, neighbors to the eagles, neighbors to the snow, neighbors to the sun: thus live the strong winds.</p>
<p>And like a wind will I one day blow amongst them, and with my spirit, take the breath from their spirit: thus wills my future.</p>
<p>A strong wind is Zarathustra to all low places; and this counsel counsels he to his enemies, and to whatever spits and spews: “Take care not to spit against the wind!”-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C13】The Sublime Ones</title>
    <url>/p/e3f83bbe/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Calm is the bottom of my sea: who would guess that it hides droll monsters!</p>
<p>Unmoved is my depth: but it sparkles with swimming enigmas and laughters.</p>
<p>A sublime one saw I today, a solemn one, a penitent of the spirit: Oh, how my soul laughed at his ugliness!</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>With upraised breast, and like those who draw in their breath: thus did he stand, the sublime one, and in silence:</p>
<p>O’erhung with ugly truths, the spoil of his hunting, and rich in torn raiment; many thorns also hung on him- but I saw no rose.</p>
<p>Not yet had he learned laughing and beauty. Gloomy did this hunter return from the forest of knowledge.</p>
<p>From the fight with wild beasts returned he home: but even yet a wild beast gazes out of his seriousness- an unconquered wild beast!</p>
<p>As a tiger does he ever stand, on the point of springing; but I do not like those strained souls; ungracious is my taste towards all those self-engrossed ones.</p>
<p>And you tell me, friends, that there is to be no dispute about taste and tasting? But all life is a dispute about taste and tasting!</p>
<p>Taste: that is weight at the same time, and scales and weigher; and alas for every living thing that would live without dispute about weight and scales and weigher!</p>
<p>Should he become weary of his sublimeness, this sublime one, then only will his beauty begin- and then only will I taste him and find him savory.</p>
<p>And only when he turns away from himself will he o’erleap his own shadow- and verily! into his sun.</p>
<p>Far too long did he sit in the shade; the cheeks of the penitent of the spirit became pale; he almost starved on his expectations.</p>
<p>Contempt is still in his eye, and loathing hides in his mouth. To be sure, he now rests, but he has not yet taken rest in the sunshine.</p>
<p>As the ox ought he to do; and his happiness should smell of the earth, and not of contempt for the earth.</p>
<p>As a white ox would I like to see him, which, snorting and lowing, walks before the plough-share: and his lowing should also laud all that is earthly!</p>
<p>Dark is still his countenance; the shadow of his hand dances upon it. O’ershadowed is still the sense of his eye.</p>
<p>His deed itself is still the shadow upon him: his doing obscures the doer. Not yet has he overcome his deed.</p>
<p>To be sure, I love in him the shoulders of the ox: but now do I want to see also the eye of the angel.</p>
<p>Also his hero-will has he still to unlearn: an exalted one shall he be, and not only a sublime one:- the ether itself should raise him, the willless one!</p>
<p>He has subdued monsters, he has solved enigmas. But he should also redeem his monsters and enigmas; into heavenly children should he transform them.</p>
<p>As yet has his knowledge not learned to smile, and to be without jealousy; as yet has his gushing passion not become calm in beauty.</p>
<p>Not in satiety shall his longing cease and disappear, but in beauty! Gracefulness belongs to the munificence of the magnanimous.</p>
<p>His arm across his head: thus should the hero repose; thus should he also overcome his repose.</p>
<p>But precisely to the hero is beauty the hardest thing of all. Unattainable is beauty by all ardent wills.</p>
<p>A little more, a little less: precisely this is much here, it is the most here.</p>
<p>To stand with relaxed muscles and with unharnessed will: that is the hardest for all of you, you sublime ones!</p>
<p>When power becomes gracious and descends into the visible- I call such condescension, beauty.</p>
<p>And from no one do I want beauty so much as from you, you powerful one: let your goodness be your last self-conquest.</p>
<p>All evil do I accredit to you: therefore do I desire of you the good.</p>
<p>I have often laughed at the weaklings, who think themselves good because they have crippled paws!</p>
<p>The virtue of the pillar shall you strive after: more beautiful does it ever become, and more graceful- but internally harder and more sustaining- the higher it rises.</p>
<p>Yes, you sublime one, one day shall you also be beautiful, and hold up the mirror to your own beauty.</p>
<p>Then will your soul thrill with divine desires; and there will be adoration even in your vanity!</p>
<p>For this is the secret of the soul: when the hero has abandoned it, then only approach it in dreams- the super-hero.</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C7】The Tarantulas</title>
    <url>/p/f795e807/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Lo, this is the tarantula’s den! Would’st you see the tarantula itself? Here hangs its web: touch this, so that it may tremble.</p>
<p>There comes the tarantula willingly: Welcome, tarantula! Black on your back is your triangle and symbol; and I know also what is in your soul.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Revenge is in your soul: wherever you bite, there arises black scab; with revenge, your poison makes the soul giddy!</p>
<p>Thus do I speak to you in parable, you who make the soul giddy, you preachers of equality! Tarantulas are you to me, and secretly revengeful ones!</p>
<p>But I will soon bring your hiding-places to the light: therefore do I laugh in your face my laughter of the height.</p>
<p>Therefore do I tear at your web, that your rage may lure you out of your den of lies, and that your revenge may leap forth from behind your word “justice.”</p>
<p>Because, for man to be redeemed from revenge- that is for me the bridge to the highest hope, and a rainbow after long storms.</p>
<p>Otherwise, however, would the tarantulas have it. “Let it be very justice for the world to become full of the storms of our vengeance”- thus do they talk to one another.</p>
<p>“Vengeance will we use, and insult, against all who are not like us”thus do the tarantula-hearts pledge themselves.</p>
<p>“And ‘Will to Equality’- that itself shall henceforth be the name of virtue; and against all that has power will we raise an outcry!”</p>
<p>You preachers of equality, the tyrant-frenzy of impotence cries thus in you for “equality”: your most secret tyrant-longings disguise themselves thus in virtue-words!</p>
<p>Fretted conceit and suppressed envy- perhaps your fathers’ conceit and envy: in you break they forth as flame and frenzy of vengeance.</p>
<p>What the father has hid comes out in the son; and oft have I found in the son the father’s revealed secret.</p>
<p>Inspired ones they resemble: but it is not the heart that inspires thembut vengeance. And when they become subtle and cold, it is not spirit, but envy, that makes them so.</p>
<p>Their jealousy leads them also into thinkers’ paths; and this is the sign of their jealousy- they always go too far: so that their fatigue has at last to go to sleep on the snow.</p>
<p>In all their lamentations sounds vengeance, in all their eulogies is maleficence; and being judge seems to them bliss.</p>
<p>But thus do I counsel you, my friends: distrust all in whom the impulse to punish is powerful!</p>
<p>They are people of bad race and lineage; out of their countenances peer the hangman and the sleuth-hound.</p>
<p>Distrust all those who talk much of their justice! in their souls not only honey is lacking.</p>
<p>And when they call themselves “the good and just,” forget not, that for them to be Pharisees, nothing is lacking but- power!</p>
<p>My friends, I will not be mixed up and confounded with others.</p>
<p>There are those who preach my doctrine of life, and are at the same time preachers of equality, and tarantulas.</p>
<p>That they speak in favor of life, though they sit in their den, these poison-spiders, and withdrawn from life- is because they would thereby do injury.</p>
<p>To those would they thereby do injury who have power at present: for with those the preaching of death is still most at home.</p>
<p>Were it otherwise, then would the tarantulas teach otherwise: and they themselves were once the best world-maligners and heretic-burners.</p>
<p>With these preachers of equality will I not be mixed up and confounded. For thus speaks justice to me: “Men are not equal.”</p>
<p>And neither shall they become so! What would be my love to the Superman, if I spoke otherwise?</p>
<p>On a thousand bridges and piers shall they throng to the future, and always shall there be more war and inequality among them: thus do my great love make me speak!</p>
<p>Inventors of figures and phantoms shall they be in their hostilities; and with those figures and phantoms shall they yet fight with each other the supreme fight!</p>
<p>Good and evil, and rich and poor, and high and low, and all names of values: weapons shall they be, and sounding signs, that life must again and again overcome itself!</p>
<p>Aloft will it build itself with columns and stairs- life itself into remote distances would it gaze, and out towards blissful beauties- therefore does it require elevation!</p>
<p>And because it requires elevation, therefore does it require steps, and variance of steps and climbers! To rise strives life, and in rising to overcome itself.</p>
<p>And just behold, my friends! Here where the tarantula’s den is, rises aloft an ancient temple’s ruins- just behold it with enlightened eyes!</p>
<p>He who here towered aloft his thoughts in stone, knew as well as the wisest ones about the secret of life!</p>
<p>That there is struggle and inequality even in beauty, and war for power and supremacy: that does he here teach us in the plainest parable.</p>
<p>How divinely do vault and arch here contrast in the struggle: how with light and shade they strive against each other, the divinely striving ones.-</p>
<p>Thus, steadfast and beautiful, let us also be enemies, my friends! Divinely will we strive against one another!-</p>
<p>Alas! There has the tarantula bit me myself, my old enemy! Divinely steadfast and beautiful, it has bit me on the finger!</p>
<p>“Punishment must there be, and justice”- so thinks it: “not gratuitously shall he here sing songs in honor of enmity!”</p>
<p>Yes, it has revenged itself! And alas! now will it make my soul also dizzy with revenge!</p>
<p>That I may not turn dizzy, however, bind me fast, my friends, to this pillar! Rather will I be a pillar-saint than a whirl of vengeance!</p>
<p>No cyclone or whirlwind is Zarathustra: and if he be a dancer, he is not at all a tarantula-dancer!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P1C15】The Thousand and One Goals</title>
    <url>/p/4a4a0f12/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Zarathustra saw many lands and many peoples: thus he discovered the good and evil of many peoples. No greater power did Zarathustra find on earth than good and evil.</p>
<p>No people could live without first valuing; if a people would preserve itself, however, it must not value as its neighbor values.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Much that passed for good with one people was regarded with scorn and contempt by another: thus I found it. Much I found here called evil, which was there decked with purple honors.</p>
<p>Never did the one neighbor understand the other: always did his soul marvel at his neighbor’s delusion and wickedness.</p>
<p>A tablet of the good hangs over every people. Behold, it is the tablet of their triumphs; behold, it is the voice of their Will to Power.</p>
<p>Laudable is all they think difficult; what is indispensable and difficult they call good; and what relieves in the direst distress, the unique and most difficult of all,- they extol as sacred.</p>
<p>Whatever makes them rule and conquer and shine, to the dismay and envy of their neighbors, they regard as the highest and most important thing, the test and the meaning of all else.</p>
<p>My brother, if you only knew a people’s need, its land, its sky, and its neighbor, then you would guess the law of its overcomings, and why it climbs up that ladder to its hope.</p>
<p>“Always shall you be the first and excel all others: your jealous soul shall love no one, except the friend”- that made the soul of a Greek thrill: thereby went he his way to greatness.</p>
<p>“To speak truth, and be skilful with bow and arrow”- so it seemed both pleasing and difficult to the people who gave me my name- the name which is both pleasing and difficult for me.</p>
<p>“To honor father and mother, and from the root of the soul to do their will”- this tablet of overcoming another people hung over them, and became powerful and permanent thereby.</p>
<p>“To be loyal, and for the sake of loyalty to risk honor and blood, even for evil and dangerous purposes”- teaching itself so, another people mastered itself, and thus mastering itself, became pregnant and heavy with great hopes.</p>
<p>Men have given to themselves all their good and evil. They did not take it, they did not find it, it did not come to them as a voice from heaven.</p>
<p>Man assigned values to things in order to preserve himself- he alone created the meaning of things, a human meaning! Therefore, calls he himself “man,” that is, the valuator.</p>
<p>Valuing is creating: hear it, you creators! Valuing itself is the treasure and jewel of all valued things.</p>
<p>Through valuation only is there value; and without valuation the nut of existence would be hollow. Hear it, you creators!</p>
<p>Change of values- that means, change of creators. Always he destroys, he who would be a creator.</p>
<p>Peoples were the first creators, and only in later times individuals; verily, the individual himself is the latest creation.</p>
<p>Peoples once hung over themselves law-tablets of the good. Love which would rule and love which would obey have created for themselves such law-tablets.</p>
<p>Pleasure in the herd is older than pleasure in the ego: and as long as the good conscience is for the herd, only the evil conscience says: “I”.</p>
<p>The crafty ego, the loveless one, that seeks its advantage in the advantage of many- it is not the origin of the herd, but its downfall.</p>
<p>It was always loving ones and creators that created good and evil. Fire of love glows in the names of all the virtues, and fire of wrath.</p>
<p>Zarathustra saw many lands, and many peoples: no greater power did Zarathustra find on earth than the creations of the loving ones- “good” and “evil” are their names.</p>
<p>A monster is this power of praising and blaming. Tell me, you brothers, who will master it for me? Who will yoke the thousand necks of this beast?</p>
<p>A thousand goals have there been so far, for a there have been a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking; there is lacking the one goal. Humanity still has no goal.</p>
<p>But pray tell me, my brothers, if the goal of humanity is still lacking, is humanity itself- not also lacking?</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P1C8】The Tree on the Hill</title>
    <url>/p/793aaa02/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Zarathustra’s eye had perceived that a certain youth avoided him. And as he walked alone one evening over the hills surrounding the town called “The Pied Cow,” behold, there he found the youth sitting leaning against a tree, and gazing with wearied look into the valley.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Zarathustra then laid hold of the tree beside which the youth sat, and spoke thus:</p>
<p>“If I wished to shake this tree with my hands, I should not be able to do so.</p>
<p>But the wind, which we do not see, troubles and bends it as it lists. We are worst bent and troubled by invisible hands.”</p>
<p>Then the youth arose disconcerted, and said: “I hear Zarathustra, and just now was I thinking of him!” Zarathustra answered:</p>
<p>“Why are you frightened on that account?- But it is the same with man as with the tree.</p>
<p>The more he seeks to rise into the height and light, the more vigorously do his roots struggle earthward, downward, into the dark and deep- into evil.”</p>
<p>“Yes, into evil!” cried the youth. “How is it possible that you have discovered my soul?”</p>
<p>Zarathustra smiled, and said: “Many a soul one can never discover, unless one firsts invents it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, into evil!” cried the youth once more.</p>
<p>“You said the truth, Zarathustra. I trust myself no longer since I sought to rise into the height, and nobody trusts me any longer; how does that happen?</p>
<p>I change too quickly: my today refutes my yesterday. I often overleap the steps when I climb; none of the steps pardons me for it.</p>
<p>When aloft, I find myself always alone. No one speaks to me; the frost of solitude makes me tremble. What do I seek in the heights?</p>
<p>My contempt and my longing increase together; the higher I climb, the more do I despise him who climbs. What does he seek in the heights?</p>
<p>How ashamed I am of my climbing and stumbling! How I mock my violent panting! How I hate him who flies! How tired I am on the height!”</p>
<p>Here the youth was silent. And Zarathustra contemplated the tree beside which they stood, and spoke thus:</p>
<p>“This tree stands lonely here on the hills; it has grown up high above man and beast.</p>
<p>And if it wanted to speak, there would be no one who could understand it: so high has it grown.</p>
<p>Now it waits and waits,- for what does it wait? It dwells too close to the seat of the clouds; it waits- for the lightning?”</p>
<p>When Zarathustra had said this, the youth called out with violent gestures: “Yes, Zarathustra, you speak the truth. I longed for my destruction, when I wanted to be in the heights, and you are the lightning for which I waited! Behold, what have I been since you have appeared amongst us? It is my envy of you that has destroyed me!”- Thus spoke the youth, and wept bitterly. Zarathustra, however, put his arm about him, and led the youth away with him.</p>
<p>And when they had walked a while together, Zarathustra began to speak thus:</p>
<p>It rends my heart. Better than your words can express it, your eyes tell me all your danger.</p>
<p>You are not yet free; you still search for freedom. You are too weary from your search, and too wakeful.</p>
<p>You aspire to the heights; you thirst for the stars. But your evil impulses also thirst for freedom.</p>
<p>Your wild dogs want freedom; they bark for joy in their cellar when your spirit trys to open all prison doors.</p>
<p>To me you are still a prisoner who seeks his freedom: ah! in such prisoners the soul becomes clever, but also deceitful and wicked.</p>
<p>And the liberated spirit must still purify himself. Much of the prison and the mould still remains in him: his eye has still to become pure.</p>
<p>Yes, I know your danger. But by my love and hope I beseech you: do not throw away your love and hope!</p>
<p>You still feel noble, and others still feel your nobility, though they bear you a grudge and cast evil glances. Know that the noble one stands in everyones way.</p>
<p>To the good, also, a noble one stands in the way: and even when they call him a good man, they want to push him aside.</p>
<p>The noble man would create the new, and a new virtue. The good want the old, and that the old should be preserved.</p>
<p>But it is not the danger of the noble man that he might become one of the good, but that he might become a blusterer, a scoffer, or a destroyer.</p>
<p>Ah! I have known noble ones who lost their highest hope. And then they slandered all high hopes.</p>
<p>Then they lived shamelessly in brief pleasures, only lived from day to day.</p>
<p>“Spirit too is lust,”- they said. The wings of their spirit are broken; and now their spirit crawls about, and defiles what it gnaws.</p>
<p>Once they thought of becoming heroes; now they are libertines. The idea of the hero offends and troubles them.</p>
<p>But by my love and hope I beseech you: do not throw away the hero in your soul! Keep sacred your highest hope!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C5】The Virtuous</title>
    <url>/p/fce73deb/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>With thunder and heavenly fireworks must one speak to indolent and somnolent senses.</p>
<p>But beauty’s voice speaks gently: it appeals only to the most awakened souls.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Gently vibrated and laughed to me to-day my buckler; it was beauty’s holy laughing and thrilling.</p>
<p>At you, you virtuous ones, laughed my beauty to-day. And thus came its voice to me: “They want- to be paid besides!”</p>
<p>You want to be paid besides, you virtuous ones! You want reward for virtue, and heaven for earth, and eternity for your to-day?</p>
<p>And now you upbraid me for teaching that there is no reward-giver, nor paymaster? And verily, I do not even teach that virtue is its own reward.</p>
<p>Ah! this is my sorrow: into the basis of things have reward and punishment been insinuated- and now even into the basis of your souls, you virtuous ones!</p>
<p>But like the snout of the boar shall my word grub up the basis of your souls; a ploughshare will I be called by you.</p>
<p>All the secrets of your heart shall be brought to light; and when you lie in the sun, grubbed up and broken, then will also your falsehood be separated from your truth.</p>
<p>For this is your truth: you are too pure for the filth of the words: vengeance, punishment, recompense, retribution.</p>
<p>You love your virtue as a mother loves her child; but when did one hear of a mother wanting to be paid for her love?</p>
<p>It is your dearest Self, your virtue. The ring’s thirst is in you: to reach itself again struggles every ring, and turns itself.</p>
<p>And like the star that goes out, so is every work of your virtue: ever is its light on its way and travelling- and when will it cease to be on its way?</p>
<p>Thus is the light of your virtue still on its way, even when its work is done. Be it forgotten and dead, still its ray of light lives and travels.</p>
<p>That your virtue is your Self, and not an outward thing, a skin, or a cloak: that is the truth from the basis of your souls, you virtuous ones!-</p>
<p>But sure enough there are those to whom virtue means writhing under the lash: and you have hearkened too much to their crying!</p>
<p>And others are there who call virtue the slothfulness of their vices; and when once their hatred and jealousy relax the limbs, their “justice” becomes lively and rubs its sleepy eyes.</p>
<p>And others are there who are drawn downwards: their devils draw them. But the more they sink, the more ardently glows their eye, and the longing for their God.</p>
<p>Ah! their crying also has reached your ears, you virtuous ones: “What I am not, that, that is God to me, and virtue!”</p>
<p>And others are there who go along heavily and creakingly, like carts taking stones downhill: they talk much of dignity and virtue- their drag they call virtue!</p>
<p>And others are there who are like eight-day clocks when wound up; they tick, and want people to call ticking- virtue.</p>
<p>In those have I my amusement: wherever I find such clocks I shall wind them up with my mockery, and they shall even whirr thereby!</p>
<p>And others are proud of their modicum of righteousness, and for the sake of it do violence to all things: so that the world is drowned in their unrighteousness.</p>
<p>Ah! how ineptly comes the word “virtue” out of their mouth! And when they say: “I am just,” it always sounds like: “I am just- revenged!”</p>
<p>With their virtues they want to scratch out the eyes of their enemies; and they elevate themselves only that they may lower others.</p>
<p>And again there are those who sit in their swamp, and speak thus from among the bulrushes: “Virtue- that is to sit quietly in the swamp.</p>
<p>We bite no one, and go out of the way of him who would bite; and in all matters we have the opinion that is given us.”</p>
<p>And again there are those who love attitudes, and think that virtue is a sort of attitude.</p>
<p>Their knees continually adore, and their hands are eulogies of virtue, but their heart knows naught thereof.</p>
<p>And again there are those who regard it as virtue to say: “Virtue is necessary”; but after all they believe only that policemen are necessary.</p>
<p>And many a one who cannot see men’s loftiness, calls it virtue to see their baseness far too well: thus calls he his evil eye virtue.And some want to be edified and raised up, and call it virtue: and others want to be cast down,- and likewise call it virtue.</p>
<p>And thus do almost all think that they participate in virtue; and at least every one claims to be an authority on “good” and “evil.”</p>
<p>But Zarathustra came not to say to all those liars and fools: “What do you know of virtue! What could you know of virtue!”But that you, my friends, might become weary of the old words which you have learned from the fools and liars:</p>
<p>That you might become weary of the words “reward,” “retribution,” “punishment,” “righteous vengeance.”That you might become weary of saying: “That an action is good is because it is unselfish.”</p>
<p>Ah! my friends! That your very Self be in your action, as the mother is in the child: let that be your formula of virtue!</p>
<p>I have taken from you a hundred formulae and your virtue’s favorite playthings; and now you upbraid me, as children upbraid.</p>
<p>They played by the sea- then came there a wave and swept their playthings into the deep: and now do they cry.</p>
<p>But the same wave shall bring them new playthings, and spread before them new speckled shells!</p>
<p>Thus will they be comforted; and like them shall you also, my friends, have your comforting- and new speckled shells!</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P1C17】The Way of the Creator</title>
    <url>/p/41969214/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Would you go into solitude, my brother? would you seek the way to yourself? The wait a moment and listen to me.</p>
<p>“He who seeks may easily get lost himself. All solitude is wrong”: so say the herd. And long did you belong to the herd.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>The voice of the herd will still echo in you. And when you say, “I no longer have a conscience in common with you,” then it will be a grief and a pain.</p>
<p>Lo, that same conscience created that pain; and the last gleam of that conscience still glows on your affliction.</p>
<p>But you would go the way of your affliction, which is the way to yourself? Then show me your right and your strength to do so!</p>
<p>Are you a new strength and a new right? A first motion? A self-rolling wheel? Can you even compel the stars to revolve around you?</p>
<p>Alas! there is so much lusting for loftiness! There are so many convulsions of the ambitious! Show me that you are not a lusting and ambitious one!</p>
<p>Alas! there are so many great thoughts that do nothing more than the bellows: they inflate, and make emptier than ever.</p>
<p>Free, do you call yourself? Then I would hear your ruling thought, and not merely that you have escaped from a yoke.</p>
<p>Are you one of those who had the right to escape from a yoke? Many a one has cast away his last worth when he has cast away his servitude.</p>
<p>Free from what? What does that matter to Zarathustra! But your fiery eyes should tell me: free for what?</p>
<p>Can you give yourself your own evil and good, and set up your own will as a law over you? Can you be judge for yourself, and avenger of your law?</p>
<p>Terrible is it to be alone with the judge and avenger of one’s own law. Thus is a star thrown into the void, and into the icy breath of solitude.</p>
<p>Today you still suffer from the many, you individual; today your courage and hopes are undiminished.</p>
<p>But one day the solitude will weary you; one day your pride will yield, and your courage quail. You will one day cry: “I am alone!”</p>
<p>One day you will no longer see your heights, and see too closely your depths; even your sublimity will frighten you like a phantom. You will one day cry: “All is false!”</p>
<p>There are feelings which seek to kill the solitary one; if they do not succeed, then they themselves must die! But are you capable of this- to be a murderer?</p>
<p>Have you ever known, my brother, the word “contempt”? And the anguish of your justice in being just to those that despise you?</p>
<p>You force many to think differently about you; that, they charge bitterly to your account. You came near to them and yet went past: for that they never forgive you.</p>
<p>You go beyond them: but the higher you rise, the smaller do you appear to the eye of envy. But the flying one is hated most of all.</p>
<p>“How could you be just to me!”- you must say- “I choose your injustice as my proper lot.</p>
<p>They cast injustice and filth at the solitary one: but, my brother, if you would be a star, you must shine for them none the less on that account!</p>
<p>And be on your guard against the good and the just! They would rather crucify those who create their own virtue- they hate the solitary ones.</p>
<p>Be on your guard, also, against holy simplicity! All that is not simple is unholy to it; it likes to play with fire and burn- at the stake.</p>
<p>And be on your guard, also, against the assaults of your love! Too readily does the recluse offer his hand to any one he meets.</p>
<p>To many you may not give a hand, but only a paw; and I want your paw to have claws.</p>
<p>But the worst enemy you can meet will always be yourself; you ambush yourself in caverns and forests.</p>
<p>You solitary one, you go the way to yourself! And your way leads you past yourself and your seven devils!</p>
<p>You will be a heretic to yourself, and a sorcerer and a soothsayer, and a fool, and a doubter, and a reprobate, and a villain.</p>
<p>You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame; how could you rise anew if you have not first become ashes!</p>
<p>You solitary one, you go the way of the creator: you will create a god for yourself out of your seven devils!</p>
<p>You solitary one, you go the way of the lover: you love yourself, and on that account you despise yourself, as only the lover can despise.</p>
<p>The lover wants to create because he despises! What does he know of love who has not despised that which he loved!</p>
<p>With your love and with your creating go into your solitude, my brother; only much later will justice limp after you.</p>
<p>With my tears, go into your solitude, my brother. I love him who seeks to create beyond himself, and thus perishes.</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <url>/p/1773cf2f/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>We do not want to be spared by our best enemies, nor by those whom we love from the very heart. So let me tell you the truth!</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>My brothers in war! I love you from the very heart. I am, and was always, your counterpart. And I am also your best enemy. So let me tell you the truth!</p>
<p>I know the hatred and envy of your hearts. You are not great enough not to know hatred and envy. Then be great enough not to be ashamed of them!</p>
<p>And if you cannot be saints of knowledge, then, I pray you, be at least its warriors. They are the companions and precursors of such saints.</p>
<p>I see many soldiers; If only I saw many warriors! “Uniform” one calls what they wear; if only what it covers were not uniform!</p>
<p>You shall be those whose eyes always seek for an enemy- for your enemy. And some of you hate at first sight.</p>
<p>You shall seek your enemy; you shall wage your war- for your thoughts! And if your thoughts perish, your honesty should still shout triumph for that!</p>
<p>You shall love peace as a means to new wars- and the short peace more than the long.</p>
<p>I recommend to you not work, but battle. I recommend to you not peace, but victory. Let your work be a battle, let your peace be a victory!</p>
<p>One can only be silent and sit peacefully when one has arrow and bow; otherwise one chatters and quarrels. Let your peace be a victory!</p>
<p>You say it is the good cause which hallows even war? I say to you: it is the good war which hallows every cause.</p>
<p>War and courage have done more great things than charity. Not your sympathy, but your bravery has before now saved the unfortunate.</p>
<p>“What is good?” you ask. To be brave is good. Let the little girls say: “The good is that which is both pretty and touching.”</p>
<p>They call you heartless: but your heart is true, and I love that you are ashamed to show it. You are ashamed of your flood, while others are ashamed of their ebb.</p>
<p>You are ugly? Well then, my brothers, wrap the sublime about you, the cloak of the ugly!</p>
<p>And when your soul becomes great, then it becomes mischievous, and in your sublimity there is mockery. I know you.</p>
<p>In mockery the mischievous man and the weakling meet. But they misunderstand each other. I know you.</p>
<p>You shall only have enemies you can hate, not enemies you despise. You must be proud of your enemy; then, the success of your enemy is also your success.</p>
<p>Disobedience- that is the nobility of slaves. Let your nobility be obedience. Let your commanding itself be an obeying!</p>
<p>To the good warrior “thou shalt” sounds better than “I will.” And all that is dear to you, you shall first have it commanded of you.</p>
<p>Let your love of life be love of your highest hope; and let your highest hope be the highest thought of life!</p>
<p>Your highest thought, however, you shall receive as a command from me- and it is this: man is something that will be overcome.</p>
<p>So live your life of obedience and of war! What matters long life! What warrior wishes to be spared!</p>
<p>I do not spare you, I love you from my very heart, my brothers in war!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

<p>For he is covetous and jealous, the monk in the moon; covetous of the earth, and all the joys of lovers.</p>
<p>No, I like him not, that tom-cat on the roofs! Hateful to me are all that slink around half-closed windows!</p>
<p>Piously and silently does he stalk along on the star-carpets:- but I like no light-treading human feet, on which not even a spur jingles.</p>
<p>Every honest one’s step speaks; the cat however, steals along over the ground. Behold, cat-like does the moon come along, and dishonestly.-</p>
<p>This parable speak I to you sentimental dissemblers, to you, the “pure discerners!” You do I call- covetous ones!</p>
<p>Also you love the earth, and the earthly: I have divined you well!- but shame is in your love, and a bad conscience- you are like the moon!</p>
<p>To despise the earthly has your spirit been persuaded, but not your bowels: these, however, are the strongest in you!</p>
<p>And now is your spirit ashamed to be at the service of your bowels, and goes in by-ways and lying ways to escape its own shame.</p>
<p>“That would be the highest thing for me”- so says your lying spirit to itself- “to gaze upon life without desire, and not like the dog, with hanging-out tongue:</p>
<p>To be happy in gazing: with dead will, free from the grip and greed of selfishness- cold and ashy-grey all over, but with intoxicated moon-eyes!</p>
<p>That would be the dearest thing to me”- thus do the seduced one seduce himself,- “to love the earth as the moon loves it, and with the eye only to feel its beauty.</p>
<p>And this do I call immaculate perception of all things: to want nothing else from them, but to be allowed to lie before them as a mirror with a hundred facets.”-</p>
<p>Oh, you sentimental dissemblers, you covetous ones! You lack innocence in your desire: and now do you defame desiring on that account!</p>
<p>Not as creators, as procreators, or as jubilators do you love the earth!</p>
<p>Where is innocence? Where there is will to procreation. And he who seeks to create beyond himself, has for me the purest will.</p>
<p>Where is beauty? Where I must will with my whole Will; where I will love and perish, that an image may not remain merely an image.</p>
<p>Loving and perishing: these have rhymed from eternity. Will to love: that is to be ready also for death. Thus do I speak to you cowards!</p>
<p>But now does your emasculated ogling profess to be “contemplation!” And that which can be examined with cowardly eyes is to be christened “beautiful!” Oh, you violators of noble names!</p>
<p>But it shall be your curse, you immaculate ones, you pure discerners, that you shall never bring forth, even though you lie broad and teeming on the horizon!</p>
<p>You fill your mouth with noble words: and we are to believe that your heart overflows, you cozeners?</p>
<p>But my words are poor, contemptible, stammering words: gladly do I pick up what falls from the table at your repasts.</p>
<p>Yet still can I say therewith the truth- to dissemblers! Yes, my fishbones, shells, and prickly leaves shall- tickle the noses of dissemblers!</p>
<p>Bad air is always about you and your repasts: your lascivious thoughts, your lies, and secrets are indeed in the air!</p>
<p>Dare only to believe in yourselves- in yourselves and in your inward parts! He who does not believe in himself always lies.</p>
<p>A God’s mask have you hung in front of you, you “pure ones”: into a God’s mask has your execrable coiling snake crawled.</p>
<p>Verily you deceive, you “contemplative ones!” Even Zarathustra was once the dupe of your godlike exterior; he did not divine the serpent’s coil with which it was stuffed.</p>
<p>A God’s soul, I once thought I saw playing in your games, you pure discerners! No better arts did I once dream of than your arts!</p>
<p>Serpents’ filth and evil odour, the distance concealed from me: and that a lizard’s craft prowled thereabouts lasciviously.</p>
<p>But I came near to you: then came to me the day,- and now comes it to you,- at an end is the moon’s love affair!</p>
<p>See there! Surprised and pale does it stand- before the rosy dawn!</p>
<p>For already she comes, the glowing one,- her love to the earth comes! Innocence, and creative desire, is all solar love!</p>
<p>See there, how she comes impatiently over the sea! Do you not feel the thirst and the hot breath of her love?</p>
<p>At the sea would she suck, and drink its depths to her height: now rises the desire of the sea with its thousand breasts.</p>
<p>Kissed and sucked would it be by the thirst of the sun; vapor would it become, and height, and path of light, and light itself!</p>
<p>Like the sun do I love life, and all deep seas.</p>
<p>And this means to me knowledge: all that is deep shall ascend- to my height!</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C16】Scholars</title>
    <url>/p/ccc0938c/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>When I lay asleep, then did a sheep eat at the ivy-wreath on my head,it ate, and said thereby: “Zarathustra is no longer a scholar.”</p>
<p>It said this, and went away clumsily and proudly. A child told it to me.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>I like to lie here where the children play, beside the ruined wall, among thistles and red poppies.</p>
<p>A scholar am I still to the children, and also to the thistles and red poppies. Innocent are they, even in their wickedness.</p>
<p>But to the sheep I am no longer a scholar: so wills my lot-blessings upon it!</p>
<p>For this is the truth: I have departed from the house of the scholars, and the door have I also slammed behind me.</p>
<p>Too long did my soul sit hungry at their table: not like them have I got the knack of investigating, as the knack of nut-cracking.</p>
<p>Freedom do I love, and the air over fresh soil; rather would I sleep on ox-skins than on their honors and dignities.</p>
<p>I am too hot and scorched with my own thought: often is it ready to take away my breath. Then have I to go into the open air, and away from all dusty rooms.</p>
<p>But they sit cool in the cool shade: they want in everything to be merely spectators, and they avoid sitting where the sun burns on the steps.</p>
<p>Like those who stand in the street and gape at the passers-by: thus do they also wait, and gape at the thoughts which others have thought.</p>
<p>Should one lay hold of them, then do they raise a dust like flour-sacks, and involuntarily: but who would divine that their dust came from corn, and from the yellow delight of the summer fields?</p>
<p>When they give themselves out as wise, then do their petty sayings and truths chill me: in their wisdom there is often an odour as if it came from the swamp; and verily, I have even heard the frog croak in it!</p>
<p>Clever are they- they have dexterous fingers: what does my simplicity pretend to beside their multiplicity! All threading and knitting and weaving do their fingers understand: thus do they make the hose of the spirit!</p>
<p>Good clockworks are they: only be careful to wind them up properly! Then do they indicate the hour without mistake, and make a modest noise thereby.</p>
<p>Like millstones do they work, and like pestles: throw only seed-corn to them!- they know well how to grind corn small, and make white dust out of it.</p>
<p>They keep a sharp eye on one another, and do not trust each other the best. Ingenious in little artifices, they wait for those whose knowledge walks on lame feet,- like spiders do they wait.</p>
<p>I saw them always prepare their poison with precaution; and always did they put glass gloves on their fingers in doing so.</p>
<p>They also know how to play with false dice; and so eagerly did I find them playing, that they perspired thereby.</p>
<p>We are alien to each other, and their virtues are even more repugnant to my taste than their falsehoods and false dice.</p>
<p>And when I lived with them, then did I live above them. Therefore did they take a dislike to me.</p>
<p>They want to hear nothing of any one walking above their heads; and so they put wood and earth and rubbish between me and their heads.</p>
<p>Thus did they deafen the sound of my tread: and least have I hitherto been heard by the most learned.</p>
<p>All mankind’s faults and weaknesses did they put between themselves and me:- they call it “false ceiling” in their houses.</p>
<p>But nevertheless I walk with my thoughts above their heads; and even should I walk on my own errors, still would I be above them and their heads.</p>
<p>For men are not equal: so speaks justice. And what I will, they may not will!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C17】Poets</title>
    <url>/p/bcbca84f/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>“Since I have known the body better”- said Zarathustra to one of his disciples- “the spirit has only been to me symbolically spirit; and all the ‘imperishable’- that is also but a parable.”</p>
<p>“So have I heard you say once before,” answered the disciple, “and then you added: ‘But the poets lie too much.’ Why did you say that the poets lie too much?”</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>“Why?” said Zarathustra. “You ask why? I do not belong to those who may be asked after their Why.</p>
<p>Is my experience but of yesterday? It is long ago that I experienced the reasons for my opinions.</p>
<p>Should I not have to be a cask of memory, if I also wanted to have my reasons with me?</p>
<p>It is already too much for me even to retain my opinions; and many a bird flies away.</p>
<p>And sometimes, also, do I find a fugitive creature in my dovecote, which is alien to me, and trembles when I lay my hand upon it.</p>
<p>But what did Zarathustra once say to you? That the poets lie too much?- But Zarathustra also is a poet.</p>
<p>Believe you that he there spoke the truth? Why do you believe it?”</p>
<p>The disciple answered: “I believe in Zarathustra.” But Zarathustra shook his head and smiled.-</p>
<p>Belief does not sanctify me, said he, least of all the belief in myself.</p>
<p>But granting that some one did say in all seriousness that the poets lie too much: he was right- we do lie too much.</p>
<p>We also know too little, and are bad learners: so we are obliged to lie.</p>
<p>And which of us poets has not adulterated his wine? Many a poisonous hotchpotch has evolved in our cellars: many an indescribable thing has there been done.</p>
<p>And because we know little, therefore are we pleased from the heart with the poor in spirit, especially when they are young women!</p>
<p>And even of those things are we desirous, which old women tell one another in the evening. This do we call the eternally feminine in us.</p>
<p>And as if there were a special secret access to knowledge, which chokes up for those who learn anything, so do we believe in the people and in their “wisdom.”</p>
<p>This, however, do all poets believe: that whoever pricks up his ears when lying in the grass or on lonely slopes, learns something of the things that are between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>And if there come to them tender emotions, then do the poets always think that nature herself is in love with them:</p>
<p>And that she steals to their ear to whisper secrets into it, and amorous flatteries: of this do they plume and pride themselves, before all mortals!</p>
<p>Ah, there are so many things between heaven and earth of which only the poets have dreamed!</p>
<p>And especially above the heavens: for all gods are poetsymbolisations, poet-sophistications!</p>
<p>Ever are we drawn aloft- that is, to the realm of the clouds: on these do we set our gaudy puppets, and then call them gods and supermen:-</p>
<p>Are not they light enough for those chairs!- all these gods and supermen?-</p>
<p>Ah, how I am weary of all the inadequate that is insisted on as actual! Ah, how I am weary of the poets!</p>
<p>When Zarathustra so spoke, his disciple resented it, but was silent. And Zarathustra also was silent; and his eye directed itself inwardly, as if it gazed into the far distance. At last he sighed and drew breath.-</p>
<p>I am of today and heretofore, said he then; but something is in me that is of the morrow, and the day following, and the hereafter.</p>
<p>I became weary of the poets, of the old and of the new: superficial are they all to me, and shallow seas.</p>
<p>They did not think sufficiently into the depth; therefore their feeling did not reach to the bottom.</p>
<p>Some sensation of voluptuousness and some sensation of tedium: these have as yet been their best contemplation.</p>
<p>Ghost-breathing and ghost-whisking, seems to me all the jinglejangling of their harps; what have they known hitherto of the fervor of tones!They are also not pure enough for me: they all muddle their water that it may seem deep.</p>
<p>And rather would they thereby prove themselves reconcilers: but mediaries and mixers are they to me, and half-and-half, and impure!Ah, I cast indeed my net into their sea, and meant to catch good fish; but always did I draw up the head of some ancient God.</p>
<p>Thus did the sea give a stone to the hungry one. And they themselves may well originate from the sea.</p>
<p>Certainly, one finds pearls in them: thereby they are the more like hard molluscs. And instead of a soul, I have often found in them salt slime.</p>
<p>They have learned from the sea also its vanity: is not the sea the peacock of peacocks?</p>
<p>Even before the ugliest of all buffaloes does it spread out its tail; never does it tire of its lace-fan of silver and silk.</p>
<p>Disdainfully does the buffalo glance thereat, nigh to the sand with its soul, closer still to the thicket, nighest, however, to the swamp.</p>
<p>What is beauty and sea and peacock-splendour to it! This parable I speak to the poets.</p>
<p>Their spirit itself is the peacock of peacocks, and a sea of vanity! Spectators seeks the spirit of the poet- should they even be buffaloes!But of this spirit became I weary; and I see the time coming when it will become weary of itself.</p>
<p>Yes, changed have I seen the poets, and their glance turned towards themselves.</p>
<p>Penitents of the spirit have I seen appearing; they grew out of the poets.</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C18】Great Events</title>
    <url>/p/d3d73bb/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>There is an isle in the sea- not far from the Blessed isles of Zarathustra on which a volcano ever smokes; of which isle the people, and especially the old women amongst them, say that it is placed as a rock before the gate of the under-world; but that through the volcano itself the narrow way leads downwards which conducts to this gate.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Now about the time that Zarathustra sojourned on the Blessed isles, it happened that a ship anchored at the isle on which stands the smoking mountain, and the crew went ashore to shoot rabbits. About the noontide hour, however, when the captain and his men were together again, they saw suddenly a man coming towards them through the air, and a voice said distinctly: “It is time! It is the highest time!” But when the figure was nearest to them (it flew past quickly, however, like a shadow, in the direction of the volcano), then did they recognize with the greatest surprise that it was Zarathustra; for they had all seen him before except the captain himself, and they loved him as the people love: in such wise that love and awe were combined in equal degree.</p>
<p>“Behold!” said the old helmsman, “there goes Zarathustra to hell!”</p>
<p>About the same time that these sailors landed on the fire-isle, there was a rumor that Zarathustra had disappeared; and when his friends were asked about it, they said that he had gone on board a ship by night, without saying where he was going.</p>
<p>Thus there arose some uneasiness. After three days, however, there came the story of the ship’s crew in addition to this uneasiness- and then did all the people say that the devil had taken Zarathustra. His disciples laughed, sure enough, at this talk; and one of them said even: “Sooner would I believe that Zarathustra has taken the devil.” But at the bottom of their hearts they were all full of anxiety and longing: so their joy was great when on the fifth day Zarathustra appeared amongst them.</p>
<p>And this is the account of Zarathustra’s interview with the fire-dog:</p>
<p>The earth, said he, has a skin; and this skin has diseases. One of these diseases, for example, is called “man.”</p>
<p>And another of these diseases is called “the fire-dog”: concerning him men have greatly deceived themselves, and let themselves be deceived.</p>
<p>To fathom this mystery did I go o’er the sea; and I have seen the truth naked, verily! barefooted up to the neck.</p>
<p>Now do I know how it is concerning the fire-dog; and likewise concerning all the spouting and subversive devils, of which not only old women are afraid.</p>
<p>“Up with you, fire-dog, out of your depth!” cried I, “and confess how deep that depth is! Whence comes that which you snort up?</p>
<p>You drink copiously at the sea: that does your embittered eloquence betray! In sooth, for a dog of the depth, you take your nourishment too much from the surface!</p>
<p>At the most, I regard you as the ventriloquist of the earth: and ever, when I have heard subversive and spouting devils speak, I have found them like you: embittered, mendacious, and shallow.</p>
<p>You understand how to roar and obscure with ashes! You are the best braggarts, and have sufficiently learned the art of making dregs boil.</p>
<p>Where you are, there must always be dregs at hand, and much that is spongy, hollow, and compressed: it wants to have freedom.</p>
<p>‘Freedom’ you all roar most eagerly: but I have unlearned the belief in ‘great events,’ when there is much roaring and smoke about them.</p>
<p>And believe me, friend Hullabaloo! The greatest events- are not our noisiest, but our still hours.</p>
<p>Not around the inventors of new noise, but around the inventors of new values, does the world revolve; inaudibly it revolves.</p>
<p>And just own to it! Little had ever taken place when your noise and smoke passed away. What, if a city did become a mummy, and a statue lay in the mud!</p>
<p>And this do I say also to the o’erthrowers of statues: It is certainly the greatest folly to throw salt into the sea, and statues into the mud.</p>
<p>In the mud of your contempt lay the statue: but it is just its law, that out of contempt, its life and living beauty grow again!</p>
<p>With diviner features does it now arise, seducing by its suffering; and verily! it will yet thank you for o’erthrowing it, you subverters!</p>
<p>This counsel, however, do I counsel to kings and churches, and to all that is weak with age or virtue- let yourselves be o’erthrown! That you may again come to life, and that virtue- may come to you!-“</p>
<p>Thus spoke I before the fire-dog: then did he interrupt me sullenly, and asked: “Church? What is that?”</p>
<p>“Church?” answered I, “that is a kind of state, and indeed the most mendacious. But remain quiet, you dissembling dog! you surely know your own species best!</p>
<p>Like yourself the state is a dissembling dog; like you does it like to speak with smoke and roaring- to make believe, like you, that it speaks out of the heart of things.</p>
<p>For it seeks by all means to be the most important creature on earth, the state; and people think it so.”</p>
<p>When I had said this, the fire-dog acted as if mad with envy. “What!” cried he, “the most important creature on earth? And people think it so?” And so much vapor and terrible voices came out of his throat, that I thought he would choke with vexation and envy.</p>
<p>At last he became calmer and his panting subsided; as soon, however, as he was quiet, I said laughingly:</p>
<p>“You are angry, fire-dog: so I am in the right about you!</p>
<p>And that I may also maintain the right, hear the story of another firedog; he speaks actually out of the heart of the earth.</p>
<p>Gold does his breath exhale, and golden rain: so does his heart desire. What are ashes and smoke and hot dregs to him!</p>
<p>Laughter flits from him like a variegated cloud; adverse is he to your gargling and spewing and grips in the bowels!</p>
<p>The gold, however, and the laughter- these does he take out of the heart of the earth: for, that you mayst know it,- the heart of the earth is of gold.”</p>
<p>When the fire-dog heard this, he could no longer endure to listen to me. Abashed did he draw in his tail, said “bow-wow!” in a cowed voice, and crept down into his cave.-</p>
<p>Thus told Zarathustra. His disciples, however, hardly listened to him: so great was their eagerness to tell him about the sailors, the rabbits, and the flying man.</p>
<p>“What am I to think of it!” said Zarathustra. “Am I indeed a ghost?</p>
<p>But it may have been my shadow. You have surely heard something of the Wanderer and his Shadow?</p>
<p>One thing, however, is certain: I must keep a tighter hold of it; otherwise it will spoil my reputation.”</p>
<p>And once more Zarathustra shook his head and wondered. “What am I to think of it!” said he once more.</p>
<p>“Why did the ghost cry: ‘It is time! It is the highest time!’</p>
<p>For what is it then- the highest time?”</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C19】The Soothsayer</title>
    <url>/p/5847b71e/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>“-And I saw a great sadness come over mankind. The best turned weary of their works.</p>
<p>A doctrine appeared, a faith ran beside it: ‘All is empty, all is alike, all has been!’</p>
<p>And from all hills there re-echoed: ‘All is empty, all is alike, all has been!’</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>To be sure we have harvested: but why have all our fruits become rotten and brown? What was it fell last night from the evil moon?</p>
<p>In vain was all our labor, poison has our wine become, the evil eye has singed yellow our fields and hearts.</p>
<p>Arid have we all become; and fire falling upon us, then do we turn dust like ashes:- yes, the fire itself have we made aweary.</p>
<p>All our fountains have dried up, even the sea has receded. All the ground tries to gape, but the depth will not swallow!</p>
<p>‘Alas! where is there still a sea in which one could be drowned?’ so sounds our plaint- across shallow swamps.</p>
<p>Even for dying have we become too weary; now do we keep awake and live on- in sepulchres.”</p>
<p>Thus did Zarathustra hear a soothsayer speak; and the foreboding touched his heart and transformed him. Sorrowfully did he go about and wearily; and he became like to those of whom the soothsayer had spoken.-</p>
<p>Said he to his disciples, a little while, and there comes the long twilight. Alas, how shall I preserve my light through it!</p>
<p>That it may not smother in this sorrowfulness! To remoter worlds shall it be a light, and also to remotest nights!</p>
<p>Thus did Zarathustra go about grieved in his heart, and for three days he did not take any meat or drink: he had no rest, and lost his speech. At last it came to pass that he fell into a deep sleep. His disciples, however, sat around him in long night-watches, and waited anxiously to see if he would awake, and speak again, and recover from his affliction.</p>
<p>And this is what Zarathustra said when he awoke; his voice, however, came to his disciples as from afar:</p>
<p>Hear, I pray you, the dream that I dreamed, my friends, and help me to divine its meaning!</p>
<p>A riddle is it still to me, this dream; the meaning is hidden in it and encaged, and do not yet fly above it on free pinions.</p>
<p>All life had I renounced, so I dreamed. Night-watchman and graveguardian had I become, aloft, in the lone mountain-fortress of Death.</p>
<p>There did I guard his coffins: full stood the musty vaults of those trophies of victory. Out of glass coffins did vanquished life gaze upon me.</p>
<p>The odour of dust-covered eternities did I breathe: sultry and dustcovered lay my soul. And who could have aired his soul there!</p>
<p>Brightness of midnight was ever around me; lonesomeness cowered beside her; and as a third, death-rattle stillness, the worst of my female friends.</p>
<p>Keys did I carry, the rustiest of all keys; and I knew how to open with them the most creaking of all gates.</p>
<p>Like a bitterly angry croaking ran the sound through the long corridors when the leaves of the gate opened: ungraciously did this bird cry, unwillingly was it awakened.</p>
<p>But more frightful even, and more heart-strangling was it, when it again became silent and still all around, and I alone sat in that malignant silence.</p>
<p>Thus did time pass with me, and slip by, if time there still was: what do I know thereof! But at last there happened that which awoke me.</p>
<p>Thrice did there peal peals at the gate like thunders, thrice did the vaults resound and howl again: then did I go to the sate.</p>
<p>Alpa! cried I, who carries his ashes to the mountain? Alpa! Alpa! who carries his ashes to the mountain?</p>
<p>And I pressed the key, and pulled at the gate, and exerted myself. But not a finger’s-breadth was it yet open:</p>
<p>Then did a roaring wind tear the folds apart: whistling, whizzing, and piercing, it threw to me a black coffin.</p>
<p>And in the roaring and whistling and whizzing, the coffin burst open, and spouted out a thousand peals of laughter.</p>
<p>And a thousand caricatures of children, angels, owls, fools, and childsized butterflies laughed and mocked, and roared at me.</p>
<p>Fearfully was I terrified thereby: it prostrated me. And I cried with horror as I ne’er cried before.</p>
<p>But my own crying awoke me:- and I came to myself.-</p>
<p>Thus did Zarathustra relate his dream, and then was silent: for as yet he knew not the interpretation thereof. But the disciple whom he loved most arose quickly, seized Zarathustra’s hand, and said:</p>
<p>“Your life itself interprets to us this dream, O Zarathustra!</p>
<p>Are you not yourself the wind with shrill whistling, which bursts open the gates of the fortress of Death?</p>
<p>Are you not yourself the coffin full of many-hued malices and angelcaricatures of life?</p>
<p>Like a thousand peals of children’s laughter comes Zarathustra into all sepulchres, laughing at those night-watchmen and grave-guardians, and whoever else rattles with sinister keys.</p>
<p>With your laughter will you frighten and prostrate them: fainting and recovering will you demonstrate your power over them.</p>
<p>And when the long twilight comes and the mortal weariness, even then will you not disappear from our firmament, you advocate of life!</p>
<p>New stars have you made us see, and new nocturnal glories: verily, laughter itself have you spread out over us like a many-hued canopy.</p>
<p>Now will children’s laughter ever from coffins flow; now will a strong wind ever come victoriously to all mortal weariness: of this you are yourself the pledge and the prophet!</p>
<p>They themselves did you dream, your enemies: that was your sorest dream.</p>
<p>But as you awoke from them and came to yourself, so shall they awaken from themselves- and come to you!</p>
<p>Thus spoke the disciple; and all the others then thronged around Zarathustra, grasped him by the hands, and tried to persuade him to leave his bed and his sadness, and return to them. Zarathustra, however, sat upright on his couch, with an absent look. Like one returning from long foreign sojourn did he look on his disciples, and examined their features; but still he knew them not. When, however, they raised him, and set him upon his feet, behold, all on a sudden his eye changed; he understood everything that had happened, stroked his beard, and said with a strong voice:</p>
<p>“Well! this has just its time; but see to it, my disciples, that we have a good repast; and without delay! Thus do I mean to make amends for bad dreams!</p>
<p>The soothsayer, however, shall eat and drink at my side: and verily, I will yet show him a sea in which he can drown himself!”-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>
<p>Then did he gaze long into the face of the disciple who had been the dream-interpreter, and shook his head.-</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>When Zarathustra went one day over the great bridge, then did the cripples and beggars surround him, and a hunchback spoke thus to him:</p>
<p>“Behold, Zarathustra! Even the people learn from you, and acquire faith in your teaching: but for them to believe fully in you, one thing is still needful- you must first of all convince us cripples! Here have you now a fine selection, and verily, an opportunity with more than one forelock! The blind can you heal, and make the lame run; and from him who has too much behind, could you well, also, take away a little;- that, I think, would be the right method to make the cripples believe in Zarathustra!”</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Zarathustra, however, answered thus to him who so spoke: When one takes his hump from the hunchback, then does one take from him his spirit- so do the people teach. And when one gives the blind man eyes, then does he see too many bad things on the earth: so that he curses him who healed him. He, however, who makes the lame man run, inflicts upon him the greatest injury; for hardly can he run, when his vices run away with him- so do the people teach concerning cripples. And why should not Zarathustra also learn from the people, when the people learn from Zarathustra?</p>
<p>It is, however, the small thing to me since I have been amongst men, to see one person lacking an eye, another an ear, and a third a leg, and that others have lost the tongue, or the nose, or the head.</p>
<p>I see and have seen worse things, and divers things so hideous, that I should neither like to speak of all matters, nor even keep silent about some of them: namely, men who lack everything, except that they have too much of one thing- men who are nothing more than a big eye, or a big mouth, or a big belly, or something else big,- reversed cripples, I call such men.</p>
<p>And when I came out of my solitude, and for the first time passed over this bridge, then I could not trust my eyes, but looked again and again, and said at last: “That is an ear! An ear as big as a man!” I looked still more attentively- and actually there did move under the ear something that was pitiably small and poor and slim. And in truth this immense ear was perched on a small thin stalk- the stalk, however, was a man! A person putting a glass to his eyes, could even recognize further a small envious countenance, and also that a bloated little soul dangled at the stalk. The people told me, however, that the big ear was not only a man, but a great man, a genius. But I never believed in the people when they spoke of great men- and I hold to my belief that it was a reversed cripple, who had too little of everything, and too much of one thing.</p>
<p>When Zarathustra had spoken thus to the hunchback, and to those of whom the hunchback was the mouthpiece and advocate, then did he turn to his disciples in profound dejection, and said:</p>
<p>My friends, I walk amongst men as amongst the fragments and limbs of human beings!</p>
<p>This is the terrible thing to my eye, that I find man broken up, and scattered about, as on a battle- and butcher-ground.</p>
<p>And when my eye flees from the present to the bygone, it finds ever the same: fragments and limbs and fearful chances- but no men!</p>
<p>The present and the bygone upon earth- ah! my friends- that is my most unbearable trouble; and I should not know how to live, if I were not a seer of what is to come.</p>
<p>A seer, a purposer, a creator, a future itself, and a bridge to the futureand alas! also as it were a cripple on this bridge: all that is Zarathustra.</p>
<p>And you also asked yourselves often: “Who is Zarathustra to us? What shall he be called by us?” And like me, did you give yourselves questions for answers.</p>
<p>Is he a promiser? Or a fulfiller? A conqueror? Or an inheritor? A harvest? Or a ploughshare? A physician? Or a healed one?</p>
<p>Is he a poet? Or a genuine one? An emancipator? Or a subjugator? A good one? Or an evil one?</p>
<p>I walk amongst men as the fragments of the future: that future which I contemplate.</p>
<p>And it is all my poetisation and aspiration to compose and collect into unity what is fragment and riddle and fearful chance.</p>
<p>And how could I endure to be a man, if man were not also the composer, and riddle-reader, and redeemer of chance!</p>
<p>To redeem what is past, and to transform every “It was” into “Thus would I have it!”- that only do I call redemption!</p>
<p>Will- so is the emancipator and joy-bringer called: thus have I taught you, my friends! But now learn this likewise: the Will itself is still a prisoner.</p>
<p>Willing emancipates: but what is that called which still puts the emancipator in chains?</p>
<p>“It was”: thus is the Will’s teeth-gnashing and most lonesome tribulation called. Impotent towards what has been done- it is a malicious spectator of all that is past.</p>
<p>Not backward can the Will will; that it cannot break time and time’s desire- that is the Will’s most lonesome tribulation.</p>
<p>Willing emancipates: what does Willing itself create in order to get free from its tribulation and mock at its prison?</p>
<p>Ah, a fool becomes every prisoner! Foolishly delivers itself also the imprisoned Will.</p>
<p>That time does not run backward- that is its animosity: “That which was”: so is the stone which it cannot roll called.</p>
<p>And thus does it roll stones out of animosity and ill-humor, and takes revenge on whatever does not, like it, feel rage and ill-humor.</p>
<p>Thus did the Will, the emancipator, become a torturer; and on all that is capable of suffering it takes revenge, because it cannot go backward.</p>
<p>This, yes, this alone is revenge itself: the Will’s antipathy to time, and its “It was.”</p>
<p>A great folly dwells in our Will; and it became a curse to all humanity, that this folly acquired spirit!</p>
<p>The spirit of revenge: my friends, that has hitherto been man’s best contemplation; and where there was suffering, it was claimed there was always penalty.</p>
<p>“Penalty,” so calls itself revenge. With a lying word it feigns a good conscience.</p>
<p>And because in the willer himself there is suffering, because he cannot will backwards- thus was Willing itself, and all life, claimed- to be penalty!</p>
<p>And then did cloud after cloud roll over the spirit, until at last madness preached: “Everything perishes, therefore everything deserves to perish!”</p>
<p>“And this itself is justice, the law of time- that he must devour his children:” thus did madness preach.</p>
<p>“Morally are things ordered according to justice and penalty. Oh, where is there deliverance from the flux of things and from the ‘existence’ of penalty?” Thus did madness preach.</p>
<p>“Can there be deliverance when there is eternal justice? Alas, unrollable is the stone, ‘It was’: eternal must also be all penalties!” Thus did madness preach.</p>
<p>“No deed can be annihilated: how could it be undone by the penalty! This, this is what is eternal in the ‘existence’ of penalty, that existence also must be eternally recurring deed and guilt!</p>
<p>Unless the Will should at last deliver itself, and Willing become nonWilling-:” but you know, my brothers, this fabulous song of madness!</p>
<p>Away from those fabulous songs did I lead you when I taught you: “The Will is a creator.”</p>
<p>All “It was” is a fragment, a riddle, a fearful chance- until the creating Will says thereto: “But thus would I have it.”-</p>
<p>Until the creating Will says thereto: “But thus do I will it! Thus shall I will it!”</p>
<p>But did it ever speak thus? And when does this take place? has the Will been unharnessed from its own folly?</p>
<p>Has the Will become its own deliverer and joy-bringer? has it unlearned the spirit of revenge and all teeth-gnashing?</p>
<p>And who has taught it reconciliation with time, and something higher than all reconciliation?</p>
<p>Something higher than all reconciliation must the Will will which is the Will to Power-: but how does that take place? Who has taught it also to will backwards?</p>
<p>-But at this point it chanced that Zarathustra suddenly paused, and looked like a person in the greatest alarm. With terror in his eyes did he gaze on his disciples; his glances pierced as with arrows their thoughts and arrear-thoughts. But after a brief space he again laughed, and said soothedly:</p>
<p>“It is difficult to live amongst men, because silence is so difficult- especially for a babbler.”-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra. The hunchback, however, had listened to the conversation and had covered his face during the time; but when he heard Zarathustra laugh, he looked up with curiosity, and said slowly:</p>
<p>“But why does Zarathustra speak otherwise to us than to his disciples?”</p>
<p>Zarathustra answered: “What is there to be wondered at! With hunchbacks one May well speak in a hunchbacked way!”</p>
<p>“Very good,” said the hunchback; “and with pupils one may well tell tales out of school.</p>
<p>But why does Zarathustra speak otherwise to his pupils- than to himself?”-</p>

    <title>【P2C21】Manly Prudence</title>
    <url>/p/46920849/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Not the height, it is the declivity that is terrible!</p>
<p>The declivity, where the gaze shoots downwards, and the hand grasps upwards. There does the heart become giddy through its double will.</p>
<p>Ah, friends, do you divine also my heart’s double will?</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>This, this is my declivity and my danger, that my gaze shoots towards the summit, and my hand would rather clutch and lean- on the depth!</p>
<p>To man clings my will; with chains do I bind myself to man, because I am pulled upwards to the Superman: for there does my other will tend.</p>
<p>And therefore do I live blindly among men, as if I knew them not: that my hand may not entirely lose belief in firmness.</p>
<p>I know not you men: this gloom and consolation is often spread around me.</p>
<p>I sit at the gateway for every rogue, and ask: Who wishes to deceive me?</p>
<p>This is my first manly prudence, that I allow myself to be deceived, so as not to be on my guard against deceivers.</p>
<p>Ah, if I were on my guard against man, how could man be an anchor to my ball! Too easily would I be pulled upwards and away!</p>
<p>This providence is over my fate, that I have to be without foresight.</p>
<p>And he who would not languish amongst men, must learn to drink out of all glasses; and he who would keep clean amongst men, must know how to wash himself even with dirty water.</p>
<p>And thus spoke I often to myself for consolation: “Courage! Cheer up! old heart! An unhappiness has failed to befall you: enjoy that as thyhappiness!”</p>
<p>This, however, is my other manly prudence: I am more forbearing to the vain than to the proud.</p>
<p>Is not wounded vanity the mother of all tragedies? Where, however, pride is wounded, there there grows up something better than pride.</p>
<p>That life may be fair to behold, its game must be well played; for that purpose, however, it needs good actors.</p>
<p>Good actors have I found all the vain ones: they play, and wish people to be fond of beholding them- all their spirit is in this wish.</p>
<p>They represent themselves, they invent themselves; in their neighborhood I like to look upon life- it cures of melancholy.</p>
<p>Therefore am I forbearing to the vain, because they are the physicians of my melancholy, and keep me attached to man as to a drama.</p>
<p>And further, who conceives the full depth of the modesty of the vain man! I am favorable to him, and sympathetic on account of his modesty.</p>
<p>From you would he learn his belief in himself; he feeds upon your glances, he eates praise out of your hands.</p>
<p>Your lies does he even believe when you lie favorably about him: for in its depths sighs his heart: “What am I?”</p>
<p>And if that be the true virtue which is unconscious of itself- well, the vain man is unconscious of his modesty!-</p>
<p>This is, however, my third manly prudence: I am not put out of conceit with the wicked by your timorousness.</p>
<p>I am happy to see the marvels the warm sun hatches: tigers and palms and rattlesnakes.</p>
<p>Also amongst men there is a beautiful brood of the warm sun, and much that is marvellous in the wicked.</p>
<p>In truth, as your wisest did not seem to me so very wise, so found I also human wickedness below the fame of it.</p>
<p>And oft did I ask with a shake of the head: Why still rattle, you rattlesnakes?</p>
<p>There is still a future even for evil! And the warmest south is still undiscovered by man.</p>
<p>How many things are now called the worst wickedness, which are only twelve feet broad and three months long! Some day, however, will greater dragons come into the world.</p>
<p>For that the Superman may not lack his dragon, the super-dragon that is worthy of him, there must still much warm sun glow on moist virgin forests!</p>
<p>Out of your wild cats must tigers have evolved, and out of your poison-toads, crocodiles: for the good hunter shall have a good hunt!</p>
<p>And verily, you good and just! In you there is much to be laughed at, and especially your fear of what has hitherto been called “the devil!”</p>
<p>So alien are you in your souls to what is great, that to you the Superman would be frightful in his goodness!</p>
<p>And you wise and knowing ones, you would flee from the solar-glow of the wisdom in which the Superman joyfully baths his nakedness!</p>
<p>You highest men who have come within my ken! this is my doubt of you, and my secret laughter: I suspect you would call my Superman- a devil!</p>
<p>Ah, I became tired of those highest and best ones: from their “height” did I long to be up, out, and away to the Superman!</p>
<p>A horror came over me when I saw those best ones naked: then there grew for me the pinions to soar away into distant futures.</p>
<p>Into more distant futures, into more southern souths than ever artist dreamed of: there, where gods are ashamed of all clothes!</p>
<p>But disguised do I want to see you, you neighbors and fellowmen, and well-attired and vain and estimable, as “the good and just;”-</p>
<p>And disguised will I myself sit amongst you- that I may mistake you and myself: for that is my last manly prudence.-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P2C22】The Stillest Hour</title>
    <url>/p/67bdf6df/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>What has happened to me, my friends? You see me troubled, driven forth, unwillingly obedient, ready to go- alas, to go away from you!</p>
<p>Yes, once more must Zarathustra retire to his solitude: but unjoyously this time does the bear go back to his cave!</p>
<p>What has happened to me? Who orders this?- Ah, my angry mistress wishes it so; she spoke to me. Have I ever named her name to you?</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Yesterday towards evening there spoke to me my still hour: that is the name of my terrible mistress.</p>
<p>And thus did it happen- for everything must I tell you, that your heart may not harden against the suddenly departing one!</p>
<p>Do you know the terror of him who falls asleep?-</p>
<p>To the very toes he is terrified, because the ground gives way under him, and the dream begins.</p>
<p>This do I speak to you in parable. Yesterday at the still hour did the ground give way under me: the dream began.</p>
<p>The hour-hand moved on, the timepiece of my life drew breath- never did I hear such stillness around me, so that my heart was terrified.</p>
<p>Then was there spoken to me without voice: “You know it, Zarathustra?”-</p>
<p>And I cried in terror at this whispering, and the blood left my face: but I was silent.</p>
<p>Then was there once more spoken to me without voice: “You know it, Zarathustra, but you do not speak it!”-</p>
<p>And at last I answered, like one defiant: “Yes, I know it, but I will not speak it!”</p>
<p>Then was there again spoken to me without voice: “You will not, Zarathustra? Is this true? Conceal yourself not behind your defiance!”-</p>
<p>And I wept and trembled like a child, and said: “Ah, I would indeed, but how can I do it! Exempt me only from this! It is beyond my power!”</p>
<p>Then was there again spoken to me without voice: “What matter about yourself, Zarathustra! Speak your word, and perish!”</p>
<p>And I answered: “Ah, is it my word? Who am I? I await the worthier one; I am not worthy even to perish by it.”</p>
<p>Then was there again spoken to me without voice: “What matter about yourself? you are not yet humble enough for me. Humility has the hardest skin.”-</p>
<p>And I answered: “What has not the skin of my humility endured! At the foot of my height do I dwell: how high are my summits, no one has yet told me. But well do I know my valleys.”</p>
<p>Then was there again spoken to me without voice: “O Zarathustra, he who has to remove mountains removes also valleys and plains.”-</p>
<p>And I answered: “As yet has my word not removed mountains, and what I have spoken has not reached man. I went, indeed, to men, but not yet have I attained to them.”</p>
<p>Then was there again spoken to me without voice: “What know you thereof! The dew falls on the grass when the night is most silent.”-</p>
<p>And I answered: “They mocked me when I found and walked in my own path; and certainly did my feet then tremble.</p>
<p>And thus did they speak to me: you forgot the path before, now do you also forget how to walk!”</p>
<p>Then was there again spoken to me without voice: “What matter about their mockery! you are one who have unlearned to obey: now shall you command!</p>
<p>Know you not who is most needed by all? He who commands great things.</p>
<p>To execute great things is difficult: but the more difficult task is to command great things.</p>
<p>This is your most unpardonable obstinacy: you have the power, and you will not rule.”-</p>
<p>And I answered: “I lack the lion’s voice for all commanding.”</p>
<p>Then was there again spoken to me as a whispering: “It is the still words which bring the storm. Thoughts that come with doves’ footsteps guide the world.</p>
<p>Zarathustra, you shall go as a shadow of that which is to come: thus will you command, and in commanding go foremost.”-</p>
<p>And I answered: “I am ashamed.”</p>
<p>Then was there again spoken to me without voice: “You must yet become a child, and be without shame.</p>
<p>The pride of youth is still upon you; late have you become young: but he who would become a child must overcome even his youth.”-</p>
<p>And I considered a long while, and trembled. At last, however, did I say what I had said at first. “I will not.”</p>
<p>Then did a laughing take place all around me. Alas, how that laughing lacerated my bowels and cut into my heart!</p>
<p>And there was spoken to me for the last time: “O Zarathustra, your fruits are ripe, but you are not ripe for your fruits!</p>
<p>So must you go again into solitude: for you shall yet become mellow.”-</p>
<p>And again was there a laughing, and it fled: then did it become still around me, as with a double stillness. I lay, however, on the ground, and the sweat flowed from my limbs.</p>
<p>-Now have you heard all, and why I have to return into my solitude. Nothing have I kept hidden from you, my friends.</p>
<p>But even this have you heard from me, who is still the most reserved of men- and will be so!</p>
<p>Ah, my friends! I should have something more to say to you! I should have something more to give to you! Why do I not give it? Am I then a niggard?-</p>
<p>When, however, Zarathustra had spoken these words, the violence of his pain, and a sense of the nearness of his departure from his friends came over him, so that he wept aloud; and no one knew how to console him. In the night, however, he went away alone and left his friends.</p>

    <title>【P3C1】The Wanderer</title>
    <url>/p/5517996d/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Then, when it was about midnight, Zarathustra went his way over the ridge of the isle, that he might arrive early in the morning at the other coast; because there he meant to embark. For there was a good roadstead there, in which foreign ships also liked to anchor: those ships took many people with them, who wished to cross over from the Blessed isles. So when Zarathustra thus ascended the mountain, he thought on the way of his many solitary wanderings from youth onwards, and how many mountains and ridges and summits he had already climbed.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>I am a wanderer and mountain-climber, said he to his heart. I love not the plains, and it seems I cannot long sit still.</p>
<p>And whatever may still overtake me as fate and experience- a wandering will be therein, and a mountain-climbing: in the end one experiences only oneself.</p>
<p>The time is now past when accidents could befall me; and what could now fall to my lot which would not already be my own!</p>
<p>It returns only, it comes home to me at last- my own Self, and such of it as has been long abroad, and scattered among things and accidents.</p>
<p>And one thing more do I know: I stand now before my last summit, and before that which has been longest reserved for me. Ah, my hardest path must I ascend! Ah, I have begun my most lonesome wandering!</p>
<p>Yet he who is of my nature does not avoid such an hour: the hour that says to him: Now only do you go the way to your greatness! Summit and abyss- these are now comprised together!</p>
<p>You go the way to your greatness: now has it become your last refuge, what was hitherto your last danger!</p>
<p>You go the way to your greatness: it must now be your best courage that there is no longer any path behind you!</p>
<p>You go the way to your greatness: here shall no one steal after you! your foot itself has effaced the path behind you, and over it stands written: Impossibility.</p>
<p>And if all ladders henceforth fail you, then must you learn to mount upon your own head: how could you mount upward otherwise?</p>
<p>Upon your own head, and beyond your own heart! Now must the gentlest in you become the hardest.</p>
<p>He who has always much-indulged himself, sickens at last by his much-indulgence. Praises on what makes hardy! I do not praise the land where butter and honey- flow!</p>
<p>To learn to look away from oneself, is necessary in order to see many things.- this hardiness is needed by every mountain-climber.</p>
<p>Yet he who is obtrusive with his eyes as a discerner, how can he ever see more of anything than its foreground!</p>
<p>But you, O Zarathustra, would view the ground of everything, and its background: thus must you mount even above yourself- up, upwards, until you have even your stars under you!</p>
<p>Yes! To look down upon myself, and even upon my stars: that only would I call my summit, that has remained for me as my last summit!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra to himself while ascending, comforting his heart with harsh maxims: for he was sore at heart as he had never been before. And when he had reached the top of the mountain-ridge, behold, there lay the other sea spread out before him; and he stood still and was long silent. The night, however, was cold at this height, and clear and starry.</p>
<p>I recognize my destiny, said he at last, sadly. Well! I am ready. Now has my last lonesomeness begun.</p>
<p>Ah, this sombre, sad sea, below me! Ah, this sombre nocturnal vexation! Ah, fate and sea! To you must I now go down!</p>
<p>Before my highest mountain do I stand, and before my longest wandering: therefore must I first go deeper down than I ever ascended:</p>
<p>-Deeper down into pain than I ever ascended, even into its darkest flood! So wills my fate. Well! I am ready.</p>
<p>Whence come the highest mountains? so did I once ask. Then did I learn that they come out of the sea.</p>
<p>That testimony is inscribed on their stones, and on the walls of their summits. Out of the deepest must the highest come to its height.-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra on the ridge of the mountain where it was cold: when, however, he came into the vicinity of the sea, and at last stood alone amongst the cliffs, then had he become weary on his way, and eagerer than ever before.</p>
<p>Everything as yet sleeps, said he; even the sea sleeps. Drowsily and strangely does its eye gaze upon me.</p>
<p>But it breaths warmly- I feel it. And I feel also that it dreams. It tosses about dreamily on hard pillows.</p>
<p>Hark! Hark! How it groans with evil recollections! Or evil expectations?</p>
<p>Ah, I am sad along with you, you dusky monster, and angry with myself even for your sake.</p>
<p>Ah, that my hand has not strength enough! Gladly, indeed, would I free you from evil dreams!-</p>
<p>And while Zarathustra thus spoke, he laughed at himself with melancholy and bitterness. What! Zarathustra, said he, will you even sing consolation to the sea?</p>
<p>Ah, you amiable fool, Zarathustra, you too-blindly confiding one! But thus have you ever been: ever have you approached confidently all that is terrible.</p>
<p>Every monster would you caress. A whiff of warm breath, a little soft tuft on its paw:- and immediately were you ready to love and lure it.</p>
<p>Love is the danger of the most lonesome one, love to anything, if it only live! Laughable, verily, is my folly and my modesty in love!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra, and laughed thereby a second time. Then, however, he thought of his abandoned friends- and as if he had done them a wrong with his thoughts, he upbraided himself because of his thoughts. And forthwith it came to pass that the laugher wept- with anger and longing wept Zarathustra bitterly.</p>

    <title>【P3C2】The Vision and the Riddle</title>
    <url>/p/437cfdfc/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>1.</p>
<p>When it got abroad among the sailors that Zarathustra was on board the ship- for a man who came from the Blessed isles had gone on board along with him,- there was great curiosity and expectation. But Zarathustra kept silent for two days, and was cold and deaf with sadness; so that he neither answered looks nor questions. On the evening of the second day, however, he again opened his ears, though he still kept silent: for there were many curious and dangerous things to be heard on board the ship, which came from afar, and was to go still further. Zarathustra, however, was fond of all those who make distant voyages, and dislike to live without danger. And behold! when listening, his own tongue was at last loosened, and the ice of his heart broke. Then did he begin to speak thus:</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>To you, the daring venturers and adventurers, and whoever has embarked with cunning sails upon frightful seas,-</p>
<p>To you the enigma-intoxicated, the twilight-enjoyers, whose souls are allured by flutes to every treacherous gulf:</p>
<p>-For you dislike to grope at a thread with cowardly hand; and where you can divine, there do you hate to calculate-</p>
<p>To you only do I tell the enigma that I saw- the vision of the most lonesome one.-</p>
<p>Gloomily walked I lately in corpse-colored twilight- gloomily and sternly, with compressed lips. Not only one sun had set for me.</p>
<p>A path which ascended daringly among boulders, an evil, lonesome path, which neither herb nor shrub any longer cheered, a mountain-path, crunched under the daring of my foot.</p>
<p>Mutely marching over the scornful clinking of pebbles, trampling the stone that let it slip: thus did my foot force its way upwards.</p>
<p>Upwards:- in spite of the spirit that drew it downwards, towards the abyss, the spirit of gravity, my devil and archenemy.</p>
<p>Upwards:- although it sat upon me, half-dwarf, half-mole; paralysed, paralysing; dripping lead in my ear, and thoughts like drops of lead into my brain.</p>
<p>“O Zarathustra,” it whispered scornfully, syllable by syllable, “you stone of wisdom! you threw yourself high, but every thrown stone mustfall!</p>
<p>O Zarathustra, you stone of wisdom, you sling-stone, you star-destroyer! Yourself threw you so high,- but every thrown stone- must fall!</p>
<p>Condemned of yourself, and to your own stoning: O Zarathustra, far indeed threw you your stone- but upon yourself will it recoil!”</p>
<p>Then was the dwarf silent; and it lasted long. The silence, however, oppressed me; and to be thus in pairs, one is verily lonesomer than when alone!</p>
<p>I ascended, I ascended, I dreamt, I thought,- but everything oppressed me. A sick one did I resemble, whom bad torture wearies, and a worse dream reawakens out of his first sleep.-</p>
<p>But there is something in me which I call courage: it has hitherto slain for me every dejection. This courage at last bade me stand still and say: “Dwarf! Thou! Or I!”-</p>
<p>For courage is the best killer,- courage which attacks: for in every attack there is sound of triumph.</p>
<p>Man, however, is the most courageous animal: thereby has he overcome every animal. With sound of triumph has he overcome every pain; human pain, however, is the sorest pain.</p>
<p>Courage kills also giddiness at abysses: and where does man not stand at abysses! Is not seeing itself- seeing abysses?</p>
<p>Courage is the best killer: courage kills also fellow-suffering. Fellowsuffering, however, is the deepest abyss: as deeply as man looks into life, so deeply also does he look into suffering.</p>
<p>Courage, however, is the best killer, courage which attacks: it kills even death itself; for it says: “Was that life? Well! Once more!”</p>
<p>In such speech, however, there is much sound of triumph. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.-</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>“Halt, dwarf!” said I. “Either I- or you! I, however, am the stronger of the two:- you knowest not my abysmal thought! It- could you not endure!”</p>
<p>Then happened that which made me lighter: for the dwarf sprang from my shoulder, the prying sprite! And it squatted on a stone in front of me. There was however a gateway just where we halted.</p>
<p>“Look at this gateway! Dwarf!” I continued, “it has two faces. Two roads come together here: these has no one yet gone to the end of.</p>
<p>This long lane backwards: it continues for an eternity. And that long lane forward- that is another eternity.</p>
<p>They are antithetical to one another, these roads; they directly abut on one another:- and it is here, at this gateway, that they come together. The name of the gateway is inscribed above: ‘This Moment.’</p>
<p>But should one follow them further- and ever further and further on, think you, dwarf, that these roads would be eternally antithetical?”-</p>
<p>“Everything straight lies,” murmured the dwarf, contemptuously. “All truth is crooked; time itself is a circle.”</p>
<p>“You spirit of gravity!” said I wrathfully, “do not take it too lightly! Or I shall let you squat where you squat, Haltfoot,- and I carried you high!”</p>
<p>“Observe,” continued I, “This Moment! From the gateway, This Moment, there runs a long eternal lane backwards: behind us lies an eternity.</p>
<p>Must not whatever can run its course of all things, have already run along that lane? Must not whatever can happen of all things have already happened, resulted, and gone by?</p>
<p>And if everything has already existed, what think you, dwarf, of This Moment? Must not this gateway also- have already existed?</p>
<p>And are not all things closely bound together in such wise that This Moment draws all coming things after it? Consequently- itself also?</p>
<p>For whatever can run its course of all things, also in this long lane outward- must it once more run!-</p>
<p>And this slow spider which creeps in the moonlight, and this moonlight itself, and you and I in this gateway whispering together, whispering of eternal things- must we not all have already existed?</p>
<p>-And must we not return and run in that other lane out before us, that long weird lane- must we not eternally return?”-</p>
<p>Thus did I speak, and always more softly: for I was afraid of my own thoughts, and arrear-thoughts. Then, suddenly did I hear a dog howl near me.</p>
<p>Had I ever heard a dog howl thus? My thoughts ran back. Yes! When I was a child, in my most distant childhood:</p>
<p>-Then did I hear a dog howl thus. And saw it also, with hair bristling, its head upwards, trembling in the still midnight, when even dogs believe in ghosts:</p>
<p>-So that it excited my commiseration. For just then went the full moon, silent as death, over the house; just then did it stand still, a glowing globe- at rest on the flat roof, as if on some one’s property:-</p>
<p>Thereby had the dog been terrified: for dogs believe in thieves and ghosts. And when I again heard such howling, then did it excite my commiseration once more.</p>
<p>Where was now the dwarf? And the gateway? And the spider? And all the whispering? Had I dreamt? Had I awakened? ‘Twixt rugged rocks did I suddenly stand alone, dreary in the dreariest moonlight.</p>
<p>But there lay a man! And there! The dog leaping, bristling, whiningnow did it see me coming- then did it howl again, then did it cry:- had I ever heard a dog cry so for help?</p>
<p>And verily, what I saw, the like had I never seen. A young shepherd did I see, writhing, choking, quivering, with distorted countenance, and with a heavy black serpent hanging out of his mouth.</p>
<p>Had I ever seen so much loathing and pale horror on one countenance? He had perhaps gone to sleep? Then had the serpent crawled into his throat- there had it bitten itself fast.</p>
<p>My hand pulled at the serpent, and pulled:- in vain! I failed to pull the serpent out of his throat. Then there cried out of me: “Bite! Bite!</p>
<p>Its head off! Bite!”- so cried it out of me; my horror, my hatred, my loathing, my pity, all my good and my bad cried with one voice out of me.-</p>
<p>You daring ones around me! You venturers and adventurers, and whoever of you have embarked with cunning sails on unexplored seas! You enigma-enjoyers!</p>
<p>Solve to me the enigma that I then beheld, interpret to me the vision of the most lonesome one!</p>
<p>For it was a vision and a foresight:- what did I then behold in parable? And who is it that must come some day?</p>
<p>Who is the shepherd into whose throat the serpent thus crawled? Who is the man into whose throat all the heaviest and blackest will thus crawl?</p>
<p>-The shepherd however bit as my cry had admonished him; he bit with a strong bite! Far away did he spit the head of the serpent:- and sprang up.-</p>
<p>No longer shepherd, no longer man- a transfigured being, a light-surrounded being, that laughed! Never on earth laughed a man as he laughed!</p>
<p>O my brothers, I heard a laughter which was no human laughter,- and now gnaws a thirst at me, a longing that is never allayed.</p>
<p>My longing for that laughter gnaws at me: oh, how can I still endure to live! And how could I endure to die at present!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P3C3】Involuntary Bliss</title>
    <url>/p/e4eaa0cf/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>With such enigmas and bitterness in his heart did Zarathustra sail o’er the sea. When, however, he was four day-journeys from the Blessed isles and from his friends, then had he overcame all his pain:- triumphantly and with firm foot did he again accept his fate. And then talked Zarathustra in this wise to his exulting conscience:</p>
<p>Alone am I again, and like to be so, alone with the pure heaven, and the open sea; and again is the afternoon around me.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>On an afternoon did I find my friends for the first time; on an afternoon, also, did I find them a second time:- at the hour when all light becomes stiller.</p>
<p>For whatever happiness is still on its way ‘twixt heaven and earth, now seeks for lodging a luminous soul: with happiness has all light now become stiller.</p>
<p>O afternoon of my life! Once did my happiness also descend to the valley that it might seek a lodging: then did it find those open hospitable souls.</p>
<p>O afternoon of my life! What did I not surrender that I might have one thing: this living plantation of my thoughts, and this dawn of my highest hope!</p>
<p>Companions did the creator once seek, and children of his hope: and lo, it turned out that he could not find them, except he himself should first create them.</p>
<p>Thus am I in the midst of my work, to my children going, and from them returning: for the sake of his children must Zarathustra perfect himself.</p>
<p>For in one’s heart one loves only one’s child and one’s work; and where there is great love to oneself, then is it the sign of pregnancy: so have I found it.</p>
<p>Still are my children verdant in their first spring, standing nigh one another, and shaken in common by the winds, the trees of my garden and of my best soil.</p>
<p>And verily, where such trees stand beside one another, there are Blessed isles!</p>
<p>But one day will I take them up, and put each by itself alone: that it may learn solitude and defiance and prudence.</p>
<p>Gnarled and crooked and with flexible hardness shall it then stand by the sea, a living lighthouse of unconquerable life.</p>
<p>Yonder where the storms rush down into the sea, and the snout of the mountain drinks water, shall each on a time have his day and night watches, for his testing and recognition.</p>
<p>Recognized and tested shall each be, to see if he be of my type and lineage:- if he be master of a long will, silent even when he speaks, and giving in such wise that he takes in giving:-</p>
<p>-So that he may one day become my companion, a fellow-creator and fellow-enjoyer with Zarathustra:- such a one as writes my will on my law-tablets, for the fuller perfection of all things.</p>
<p>And for his sake and for those like him, must I perfect myself: therefore do I now avoid my happiness, and present myself to every misfortune- for my final testing and recognition.</p>
<p>And verily, it were time that I went away; and the wanderer’s shadow and the longest tedium and the still hour- have all said to me: “It is the highest time!”</p>
<p>The word blew to me through the keyhole and said “Come!” The door sprang subtly open to me, and said “Go!”</p>
<p>But I lay enchained to my love for my children: desire spread this snare for me- the desire for love- that I should become the prey of my children, and lose myself in them.</p>
<p>Desiring- that is now for me to have lost myself. I possess you, my children! In this possessing shall everything be assurance and nothing desire.</p>
<p>But brooding lay the sun of my love upon me, in his own juice stewed Zarathustra,- then did shadows and doubts fly past me.</p>
<p>For frost and winter I now longed: “Oh, that frost and winter would again make me crack and crunch!” sighed I:- then arose icy mist out of me.</p>
<p>My past burst its tomb, many pains buried alike woke up:- fully slept had they merely, concealed in corpse-clothes.</p>
<p>So called everything to me in signs: “It is time!” But I- heard not, until at last my abyss moved, and my thought bit me.</p>
<p>Ah, abysmal thought, which are my thought! When shall I find strength to hear you burrowing, and no longer tremble?</p>
<p>To my very throat throbs my heart when I hear them burrowing! your muteness even is like to strangle me, you abysmal mute one!</p>
<p>As yet have I never ventured to call you up; it has been enough that Ihave carried you about with me! As yet have I not been strong enough for my final lion-wantonness and playfulness.</p>
<p>Sufficiently formidable to me has your weight ever been: but one day shall I yet find the strength and the lion’s voice which will call you up!</p>
<p>When I shall have overcame myself therein, then will I overcome myself also in that which is greater; and a victory shall be the seal of my perfection!-</p>
<p>Meanwhile do I sail along on uncertain seas; chance flatters me, smooth-tongued chance; forward and backward do I gaze-, still see I no end.</p>
<p>As yet has the hour of my final struggle not come to me- or does it come to me perhaps just now? with insidious beauty do sea and life gaze upon me round about:</p>
<p>O afternoon of my life! O happiness before eventide! O haven upon high seas! O peace in uncertainty! How I distrust all of you!</p>
<p>Distrustful am I of your insidious beauty! Like the lover am I, who distrusts too sleek smiling.</p>
<p>As he pushes the best-beloved before him- tender even in severity, the jealous one-, so do I push this blissful hour before me.</p>
<p>Away with you, you blissful hour! With you has there come to me an involuntary bliss! Ready for my severest pain do I here stand:- at the wrong time have you come!</p>
<p>Away with you, you blissful hour! Rather harbor there- with my children! Hasten! and bless them before eventide with my happiness!</p>
<p>There, already approaches eventide: the sun sinks. Away- my happiness!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra. And he waited for his misfortune the whole night; but he waited in vain. The night remained clear and calm, and happiness itself came closer and closer to him. Towards morning, however, Zarathustra laughed to his heart, and said mockingly: “Happiness runs after me. That is because I do not run after women. Happiness, however, is a woman.”</p>

    <title>【P3C4】Before Sunrise</title>
    <url>/p/f02b06ae/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>O heaven above me, you pure, you deep heaven! you abyss of light! Gazing on you, I tremble with divine desires.</p>
<p>Up to your height to toss myself- that is my depth! In your purity to hide myself- that is my innocence!</p>
<p>The God veils his beauty: thus hide you your stars. You speak not: thus proclaim you your wisdom to me.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Mute o’er the raging sea have you risen for me to-day; your love and your modesty make a revelation to my raging soul.</p>
<p>In that you came to me beautiful, veiled in your beauty, in that you spoke to me mutely, obvious in your wisdom:</p>
<p>Oh, how could I fail to divine all the modesty of your soul! Before the sun did you come to me- the most lonesome one.</p>
<p>We have been friends from the beginning: to us are grief, gruesomeness, and ground common; even the sun is common to us.</p>
<p>We do not speak to each other, because we know too much-: we keep silent to each other, we smile our knowledge to each other.</p>
<p>Are you not the light of my fire? have you not the sister-soul of my insight?</p>
<p>Together did we learn everything; together did we learn to ascend beyond ourselves to ourselves, and to smile uncloudedly:-</p>
<p>-Uncloudedly to smile down out of luminous eyes and out of miles of distance, when under us constraint and purpose and guilt stream like rain.</p>
<p>And wandered I alone, for what did my soul hunger by night and in labyrinthine paths? And climbed I mountains, whom did I ever seek, if not you, upon mountains?</p>
<p>And all my wandering and mountain-climbing: a necessity was it merely, and a makeshift of the unhandy one:- to fly only, wants my entire will, to fly into you!</p>
<p>And what have I hated more than passing clouds, and whatever taints you? And my own hatred have I even hated, because it tainted you!</p>
<p>The passing clouds I detest- those stealthy cats of prey: they take from you and me what is common to us- the vast unbounded Yes- and Amensaying.</p>
<p>These mediators and mixers we detest- the passing clouds: those half-and-half ones, that have neither learned to bless nor to curse from the heart.</p>
<p>Rather will I sit in a tub under a closed heaven, rather will I sit in the abyss without heaven, than see you, you luminous heaven, tainted with passing clouds!</p>
<p>And oft have I longed to pin them fast with the jagged gold-wires of lightning, that I might, like the thunder, beat the drum upon their kettlebellies:-</p>
<p>-An angry drummer, because they rob me of your Yes and Amen!- you heaven above me, you pure, you luminous heaven! you abyss of light!because they rob you of my Yes and Amen.</p>
<p>For rather will I have noise and thunders and tempest-blasts, than this discreet, doubting cat-repose; and also amongst men do I hate most of all the soft-treaders, and half-and-half ones, and the doubting, hesitating, passing clouds.</p>
<p>And “he who cannot bless shall learn to curse!”- this clear teaching dropt to me from the clear heaven; this star stands in my heaven even in dark nights.</p>
<p>I, however, am a blesser and a Yes-sayer, if you be but around me, you pure, you luminous heaven! you abyss of light!- into all abysses do I then carry my beneficent Yes-saying.</p>
<p>A blesser have I become and a Yes-sayer: and therefore strove I long and was a striver, that I might one day get my hands free for blessing.</p>
<p>This, however, is my blessing: to stand above everything as its own heaven, its round roof, its azure bell and eternal security: and blessed is he who thus blesses!</p>
<p>For all things are baptized at the font of eternity, and beyond good and evil; good and evil themselves, however, are but fugitive shadows and damp afflictions and passing clouds.</p>
<p>It is a blessing and not a blasphemy when I teach that “above all things there stands the heaven of chance, the heaven of innocence, the heaven of hazard, the heaven of wantonness.”</p>
<p>“Of Hazard”- that is the oldest nobility in the world; that gave I back to all things; I emancipated them from bondage under purpose.</p>
<p>This freedom and celestial serenity did I put like an azure bell above all things, when I taught that over them and through them, no “eternal Will”- wills.</p>
<p>This wantonness and folly did I put in place of that Will, when I taught that “In everything there is one thing impossible- rationality!”</p>
<p>A little reason, to be sure, a germ of wisdom scattered from star to star- this leaven is mixed in all things: for the sake of folly, wisdom is mixed in all things!</p>
<p>A little wisdom is indeed possible; but this blessed security have I found in all things, that they prefer- to dance on the feet of chance.</p>
<p>O heaven above me! you pure, you lofty heaven! This is now your purity to me, that there is no eternal reason-spider and reason-cobweb:-</p>
<p>-That you are to me a dancing-floor for divine chances, that you are to me a table of the Gods, for divine dice and dice-players!-</p>
<p>But you blush? Have I spoken unspeakable things? Have I abused, when I meant to bless you?</p>
<p>Or is it the shame of being two of us that makes you blush!- do you bid me go and be silent, because now- day comes?</p>
<p>The world is deep:- and deeper than e’er the day could read. Not everything may be uttered in presence of day. But day comes: so let us part!</p>
<p>O heaven above me, you modest one! you glowing one! O you, my happiness before sunrise! The day comes: so let us part!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P3C5】Virtue That Diminishes</title>
    <url>/p/1154b163/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>1.<br>When Zarathustra was again on the continent, he did not go straightway to his mountains and his cave, but made many wanderings and questionings, and ascertained this and that; so that he said of himself jestingly: “Lo, a river that flows back to its source in many windings!” For he wanted to learn what had taken place among men during the interval: whether they had become greater or smaller. And once, when he saw a row of new houses, he marvelled, and said:</p>
<p>“What do these houses mean? no great soul put them up as its simile!</p>
<p>Did perhaps a silly child take them out of its toy-box? Would that another child put them again into the box!</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>And these rooms and chambers- can men go out and in there? They seem to be made for silk dolls; or for dainty-eaters, who perhaps let others eat with them.”</p>
<p>And Zarathustra stood still and meditated. At last he said sorrowfully: “There has everything become smaller!</p>
<p>Everywhere do I see lower doorways: he who is of my type can still go therethrough, but- he must stoop!</p>
<p>Oh, when shall I arrive again at my home, where I shall no longer have to stoop- shall no longer have to stoop before the small ones!”- And Zarathustra sighed, and gazed into the distance.-</p>
<p>The same day, however, he spoke on the virtue that makes small.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>I pass through this people and keep my eyes open: they do not forgive me for not envying their virtues.</p>
<p>They bite at me, because I say to them that for small people, small virtues are necessary- and because it is hard for me to understand that small people are necessary!</p>
<p>Here am I still like a cock in a strange farm-yard, at which even the hens peck: but on that account I am not unfriendly to the hens.</p>
<p>I am courteous towards them, as towards all small annoyances; to be prickly towards what is small, seems to me wisdom for hedgehogs.</p>
<p>They all speak of me when they sit around their fire in the eveningthey speak of me, but no one thinks- of me!</p>
<p>This is the new stillness which I have experienced: their noise around me spreads a mantle over my thoughts.</p>
<p>They shout to one another: “What is this gloomy cloud about to do to us? Let us see that it does not bring a plague upon us!”</p>
<p>And recently did a woman seize upon her child that was coming to me: “Take the children away,” cried she, “such eyes scorch children’s souls.”</p>
<p>They cough when I speak: they think coughing an objection to strong winds- they divine nothing of the boisterousness of my happiness!</p>
<p>“We have not yet time for Zarathustra”- so they object; but what matter about a time that “has no time” for Zarathustra?</p>
<p>And if they should altogether praise me, how could I go to sleep on their praise? A girdle of spines is their praise to me: it scratches me even when I take it off.</p>
<p>And this also did I learn among them: the praiser does as if he gave back; in truth, however, he wants more to be given him!</p>
<p>Ask my foot if their lauding and luring strains please it! to such measure and ticktack, it likes neither to dance nor to stand still.</p>
<p>To small virtues would they rather lure and laud me; to the ticktack of small happiness would they rather persuade my foot.</p>
<p>I pass through this people and keep my eyes open; they have become smaller, and ever become smaller:- the reason thereof is their doctrine of happiness and virtue.</p>
<p>For they are moderate also in virtue,- because they want comfort. With comfort, however, moderate virtue only is compatible.</p>
<p>To be sure, they also learn in their way to stride on and stride forward: that, I call their hobbling.- Thereby they become a hindrance to all who are in haste.</p>
<p>And many of them go forward, and look backwards thereby, with stiffened necks: those do I like to run up against.</p>
<p>Foot and eye shall not lie, nor give the lie to each other. But there is much lying among small people.</p>
<p>Some of them will, but most of them are willed. Some of them are genuine, but most of them are bad actors.</p>
<p>There are actors without knowing it amongst them, and actors without intending it-, the genuine ones are always rare, especially the genuine actors.</p>
<p>Of man there is little here: therefore do their women masculinize themselves. For only he who is man enough, will- save the woman in woman.</p>
<p>And this hypocrisy found I worst amongst them, that even those who command feign the virtues of those who serve.</p>
<p>“I serve, you serve, we serve”- so chants here even the hypocrisy of the rulers- and alas! if the first lord be only the first servant!</p>
<p>Ah, even upon their hypocrisy did my eyes’ curiosity alight; and well did I divine all their fly- happiness, and their buzzing around sunny window-panes.</p>
<p>So much kindness, so much weakness do I see. So much justice and pity, so much weakness.</p>
<p>Round, fair, and considerate are they to one another, as grains of sand are round, fair, and considerate to grains of sand.</p>
<p>Modestly to embrace a small happiness- that do they call “submission”! and at the same time they peer modestly after a new small happiness.</p>
<p>In their hearts they want simply one thing most of all: that no one hurt them. Thus do they anticipate every one’s wishes and do well to every one.</p>
<p>That, however, is cowardice, though it be called “virtue.”-</p>
<p>And when they chance to speak harshly, those small people, then do I hear therein only their hoarseness- every draught of air makes them hoarse.</p>
<p>Shrewd indeed are they, their virtues have shrewd fingers. But they lack fists: their fingers do not know how to creep behind fists.</p>
<p>Virtue for them is what makes modest and tame: therewith have they made the wolf a dog, and man himself man’s best domestic animal.</p>
<p>“We set our chair in the midst”- so says their smirking to me- “and as far from dying gladiators as from satisfied swine.”</p>
<p>That, however, is- mediocrity, though it be called moderation.-</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>I pass through this people and let fall many words: but they know neither how to take nor how to retain them.</p>
<p>They wonder why I came not to revile venery and vice; and verily, I came not to warn against pickpockets either!</p>
<p>They wonder why I am not ready to abet and whet their wisdom: as if they had not yet enough of wiseacres, whose voices grate on my ear like slate-pencils!</p>
<p>And when I call out: “Curse all the cowardly devils in you, that would rather whimper and fold the hands and adore”- then do they shout: “Zarathustra is godless.”</p>
<p>And especially do their teachers of submission shout this;- but precisely in their ears do I love to cry: “Yes! I am Zarathustra, the godless!”</p>
<p>Those teachers of submission! Wherever there is anything puny, or sickly, or scabby, there do they creep like lice; and only my disgust prevents me from cracking them.</p>
<p>Well! This is my sermon for their ears: I am Zarathustra the godless, who says: “Who is more godless than I, that I may enjoy his teaching?”</p>
<p>I am Zarathustra the godless: where do I find my equal? And all those are my equals who give to themselves their Will, and divest themselves of all submission.</p>
<p>I am Zarathustra the godless! I cook every chance in my pot. And only when it has been quite cooked do I welcome it as my food.</p>
<p>And verily, many a chance came imperiously to me: but still more imperiously did my Will speak to it,- then did it lie imploringly upon its knees-</p>
<p>-Imploring that it might find home and heart with me, and saying flatteringly: “See, O Zarathustra, how friend only comes to friend!”-</p>
<p>But why talk I, when no one has my ears! And so will I shout it out to all the winds:</p>
<p>You ever become smaller, you small people! You crumble away, you comfortable ones! You will yet perish-</p>
<p>-By your many small virtues, by your many small omissions, and by your many small submissions!</p>
<p>Too tender, too yielding: so is your soil! But for a tree to become great, it seeks to twine hard roots around hard rocks!</p>
<p>Also what you omit weaves at the web of all the human future; even your naught is a cobweb, and a spider that lives on the blood of the future.</p>
<p>And when you take, then is it like stealing, you small virtuous ones; but even among knaves honor says that “one shall only steal when one cannot rob.”</p>
<p>“It gives itself”- that is also a doctrine of submission. But I say to you, you comfortable ones, that it takes to itself, and will ever take more and more from you!</p>
<p>Ah, that you would renounce all half-willing, and would decide for idleness as you decide for action!</p>
<p>Ah, that you understood my word: “Do ever what you will- but first be such as can will.</p>
<p>Love ever your neighbor as yourselves- but first be such as love themselves-</p>
<p>-Such as love with great love, such as love with great contempt!” Thus speaks Zarathustra the godless.But why talk I, when no one has my ears! It is still an hour too early for me here.</p>
<p>My own forerunner am I among this people, my own cockcrow in dark lanes.</p>
<p>But their hour comes! And there comes also mine! Hourly do they become smaller, poorer, unfruitfuller,- poor herbs! poor earth!</p>
<p>And soon shall they stand before me like dry grass and prairie, and verily, weary of themselves- and panting for fire, more than for water!</p>
<p>O blessed hour of the lightning! O mystery before noontide!- Running fires will I one day make of them, and heralds with flaming tongues:-</p>
<p>-Herald shall they one day with flaming tongues: It comes, it is nigh, the great noontide!</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P3C6】The Mount of Olives</title>
    <url>/p/51222fea/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Winter, a bad guest, sits with me at home; blue are my hands with his friendly hand-shaking.</p>
<p>I honor him, that bad guest, but gladly leave him alone. Gladly do I run away from him; and when one runs well, then one escapes him!</p>
<p>With warm feet and warm thoughts do I run where the wind is calmto the sunny corner of my olive-mount.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>There do I laugh at my stern guest, and am still fond of him; because he clears my house of flies, and quiets many little noises.</p>
<p>For he suffers it not if a gnat wants to buzz, or even two of them; also the lanes makes he lonesome, so that the moonlight is afraid there at night.</p>
<p>A hard guest is he,- but I honor him, and do not worship, like the tenderlings, the pot-bellied fire-idol.</p>
<p>Better even a little teeth-chattering than idol-adoration!- so wills my nature. And especially have I a grudge against all ardent, steaming, steamy fire-idols.</p>
<p>Him whom I love, I love better in winter than in summer; better do I now mock at my enemies, and more heartily, when winter sits in my house.</p>
<p>Heartily, verily, even when I creep into bed-: there, still laughs and wantons my hidden happiness; even my deceptive dream laughs.</p>
<p>I, a- creeper? Never in my life did I creep before the powerful; and if ever I lied, then did I lie out of love. Therefore am I glad even in my winter-bed.</p>
<p>A poor bed warms me more than a rich one, for I am jealous of my poverty. And in winter she is most faithful to me.</p>
<p>With a wickedness do I begin every day: I mock at the winter with a cold bath: on that account grumbles my stern house-mate.</p>
<p>Also do I like to tickle him with a wax-taper, that he may finally let the heavens emerge from ashy-grey twilight.</p>
<p>For especially wicked am I in the morning: at the early hour when the pail rattles at the well, and horses neigh warmly in grey lanes:-</p>
<p>Impatiently do I then wait, that the clear sky may finally dawn for me, the snow-bearded winter-sky, the hoary one, the white-head,-</p>
<p>-The winter-sky, the silent winter-sky, which often stifles even its sun! Did I perhaps learn from it the long clear silence? Or did it learn it from me? Or has each of us created it himself?</p>
<p>Of all good things the origin is a thousandfold,- all good roguish things spring into existence for joy: how could they always do so- for once only!</p>
<p>A good roguish thing is also the long silence, and to look, like the winter-sky, out of a clear, round-eyed countenance:-</p>
<p>-Like it to stifle one’s sun, and one’s inflexible solar will: verily, this art and this winter-roguishness have I learned well!</p>
<p>My best-loved wickedness and art is it, that my silence has learned not to betray itself by silence.</p>
<p>Clattering with diction and dice, I outwit the solemn assistants: all those stern watchers, shall my will and purpose elude.</p>
<p>That no one might see down into my depth and into my ultimate willfor that purpose did I create the long clear silence.</p>
<p>Many a shrewd one did I find: he veiled his countenance and made his water muddy, that no one might see therethrough and thereunder.</p>
<p>But precisely to him came the shrewder distrusters and nut-crackers: precisely from him did they fish his best-concealed fish!</p>
<p>But the clear, the honest, the transparent- these are for me the wisest silent ones: in them, so profound is the depth that even the clearest water does not- betray it.You snow-bearded, silent, winter-sky, you round-eyed whitehead above me! Oh, you heavenly parable of my soul and its wantonness!</p>
<p>And must I not conceal myself like one who has swallowed gold- lest my soul should be ripped up?</p>
<p>Must I not wear stilts, that they may overlook my long legs- all those enviers and injurers around me?</p>
<p>Those dingy, fire-warmed, used-up, green-tinted, ill-natured soulshow could their envy endure my happiness!</p>
<p>Thus do I show them only the ice and winter of my peaks- and not that my mountain winds all the solar girdles around it!</p>
<p>They hear only the whistling of my winter-storms: and know not that I also travel over warm seas, like longing, heavy, hot south-winds.</p>
<p>They commiserate also my accidents and chances:- but my word says: “Suffer the chance to come to me: innocent is it as a little child!”</p>
<p>How could they endure my happiness, if I did not put around it accidents, and winter-privations, and bear-skin caps, and enmantling snowflakes!</p>
<p>-If I did not myself commiserate their pity, the pity of those enviers and injurers!</p>
<p>-If I did not myself sigh before them, and chatter with cold, and patiently let myself be swathed in their pity!</p>
<p>This is the wise waggish-will and good-will of my soul, that it conceals not its winters and glacial storms; it conceals not its chilblains either.</p>
<p>To one man, solitude is the flight of the sick one; to another, it is the flight from the sick ones.</p>
<p>Let them hear me chattering and sighing with winter-cold, all those poor squinting knaves around me! With such sighing and chattering do I flee from their heated rooms.</p>
<p>Let them sympathise with me and sigh with me on account of my chilblains: “At the ice of knowledge will he yet freeze to death!”- so they mourn.</p>
<p>Meanwhile do I run with warm feet here and there on my olivemount: in the sunny corner of my olive-mount do I sing, and mock at all pity.-</p>
<p>Thus sang Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P3C7】Passing By</title>
    <url>/p/63879135/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Thus slowly wandering through many peoples and divers cities, did Zarathustra return by round-about roads to his mountains and his cave. And behold, thereby came he unawares also to the gate of the great city. Here, however, a foaming fool, with extended hands, sprang forward to him and stood in his way. It was the same fool whom the people called “the ape of Zarathustra:” for he had learned from him something of the expression and modulation of language, and perhaps liked also to borrow from the store of his wisdom. And the fool talked thus to Zarathustra:</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>O Zarathustra, here is the great city: here have you nothing to seek and everything to lose.</p>
<p>Why would you wade through this mire? Have pity upon your foot! Spit rather on the gate of the city, and- turn back!</p>
<p>Here is the hell for hermits’ thoughts: here are great thoughts seethed alive and boiled small.</p>
<p>Here do all great sentiments decay: here may only rattle-boned sensations rattle!</p>
<p>Smell you not already the shambles and cookshops of the spirit? Steams not this city with the fumes of slaughtered spirit?</p>
<p>See you not the souls hanging like limp dirty rags?- And they make newspapers also out of these rags!</p>
<p>Hear you not how spirit has here become a verbal game? Loathsome verbal swill does it vomit forth!- And they make newspapers also out of this verbal swill.</p>
<p>They hound one another, and know not where! They inflame one another, and know not why! They tinkle with their pinchbeck, they jingle with their gold.</p>
<p>They are cold, and seek warmth from distilled waters: they are inflamed, and seek coolness from frozen spirits; they are all sick and sore through public opinion.</p>
<p>All lusts and vices are here at home; but here there are also the virtuous; there is much appointable appointed virtue:-</p>
<p>Much appointable virtue with scribe-fingers, and hardy sitting-flesh and waiting-flesh, blessed with small breast-stars, and padded, haunchless daughters.</p>
<p>There is here also much piety, and much faithful spittle-licking and spittle-backing, before the God of Hosts.</p>
<p>“From on high,” drips the star, and the gracious spittle; for the high, longs every starless bosom.</p>
<p>The moon has its court, and the court has its moon-calves: to all, however, that comes from the court do the mendicant people pray, and all appointable mendicant virtues.</p>
<p>“I serve, you serve, we serve”- so prays all appointable virtue to the prince: that the merited star may at last stick on the slender breast!</p>
<p>But the moon still revolves around all that is earthly: so revolves also the prince around what is earthliest of all- that, however, is the gold of the shopman.</p>
<p>The God of the Hosts of war is not the God of the golden bar; the prince proposes, but the shopman- disposes!</p>
<p>By all that is luminous and strong and good in you, O Zarathustra! Spit on this city of shopmen and return back!</p>
<p>Here flows all blood putridly and tepidly and frothily through all veins: spit on the great city, which is the great slum where all the scum froths together!</p>
<p>Spit on the city of compressed souls and slender breasts, of pointed eyes and sticky fingers-</p>
<p>-On the city of the obtrusive, the brazen-faced, the pen-demagogues and tongue-demagogues, the overheated ambitious:Where everything maimed, ill-famed, lustful, untrustful, over-mellow, sickly-yellow and seditious, festers perniciously:-</p>
<p>-Spit on the great city and turn back!Here, however, did Zarathustra interrupt the foaming fool, and shut his mouth.-</p>
<p>Stop this at once! called out Zarathustra, long have your speech and your species disgusted me!</p>
<p>Why did you live so long by the swamp, that you yourself had to become a frog and a toad?</p>
<p>Flows there not a tainted, frothy, swamp-blood in your own veins, when you have thus learned to croak and revile?</p>
<p>Why went you not into the forest? Or why did you not till the ground? Is the sea not full of green islands?</p>
<p>I despise your contempt; and when you warned me- why did you not warn yourself?</p>
<p>Out of love alone shall my contempt and my warning bird take wing; but not out of the swamp!-</p>
<p>They call you my ape, you foaming fool: but I call you my gruntingpig,- by your grunting, you spoil even my praise of folly.</p>
<p>What was it that first made you grunt? Because no one sufficiently flattered you:- therefore did you seat yourself beside this filth, that you might have cause for much grunting,-</p>
<p>-That you might have cause for much vengeance! For vengeance, you vain fool, is all your foaming; I have divined you well!</p>
<p>But your fools’-word injures me, even when you are right! And even if Zarathustra’s word were a hundred times justified, you would ever- do wrong with my word!</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra. Then did he look on the great city and sighed, and was long silent. At last he spoke thus:</p>
<p>I loathe also this great city, and not only this fool. Here and therethere is nothing to better, nothing to worsen.</p>
<p>Woe to this great city!- And I would that I already saw the pillar of fire in which it will be consumed!</p>
<p>For such pillars of fire must precede the great noontide. But this has its time and its own fate.-</p>
<p>This precept, however, give I to you, in parting, you fool: Where one can no longer love, there should one- pass by!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra, and passed by the fool and the great city.</p>

    <title>【P3C8】The Apostates</title>
    <url>/p/99ca79e1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>1.<br>Ah, lies everything already withered and grey which but lately stood green and many-hued on this meadow! And how much honey of hope did I carry hence into my beehives!</p>
<p>Those young hearts have already all become old- and not old even! only weary, ordinary, comfortable:- they declare it: “We have again become pious.”</p>
<p>Of late did I see them run forth at early morn with valorous steps: but the feet of their knowledge became weary, and now do they malign even their morning valor!</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Many of them once lifted their legs like the dancer; to them winked the laughter of my wisdom:- then did they bethink themselves. Just now have I seen them bent down- to crawl before the cross.</p>
<p>Around light and liberty did they once flutter like gnats and young poets. A little older, a little colder: and already are they mystifiers, and mumblers and mollycoddles.</p>
<p>Did perhaps their hearts despond, because solitude had swallowed me like a whale? Did their ear perhaps hearken yearningly-long for me in vain, and for my trumpet-notes and herald-calls?</p>
<p>-Ah! Ever are there but few of those whose hearts have persistent courage and exuberance; and in such remains also the spirit patient. The rest, however, are cowardly.</p>
<p>The rest: these are always the great majority, the common-place, the superfluous, the all-too-many- those all are cowardly!-</p>
<p>Him who is of my type, will also the experiences of my type meet on the way: so that his first companions must be corpses and fools.</p>
<p>His second companions, however- they will call themselves his believers,- will be a living host, with much love, much folly, much unbearded veneration.</p>
<p>To those believers shall he who is of my type among men not bind his heart; in those spring-times and many-hued meadows shall he not believe, who knows the fickly faint-hearted human species!</p>
<p>Could they do otherwise, then would they also will otherwise. The half-and-half spoil every whole. That leaves become withered,- what is there to lament about that!</p>
<p>Let them go and fall away, O Zarathustra, and do not lament! Better even to blow amongst them with rustling winds,-</p>
<p>-Blow amongst those leaves, O Zarathustra, that everything withered may run away from you the faster!-</p>
<p>2.<br>“We have again become pious”- so do those apostates confess; and some of them are still too pusillanimous thus to confess.</p>
<p>To them I look into the eye,- before them I say it to their face and to the blush on their cheeks: You are those who again pray!</p>
<p>It is shameful to pray! Not for all, but for you, and me, and whoever has his conscience in his head. For you it is shameful to pray!</p>
<p>You know it well: the faint-hearted devil in you, which would rather fold its arms, and place its hands in its bosom, and take it easier:- this faint-hearted devil persuades you that “there is a God!”</p>
<p>Thereby, however, do you belong to the light-dreading type, to whom light never permits repose: now must you daily thrust your head deeper into obscurity and vapor!</p>
<p>And verily, you choose the hour well: for just now do the nocturnal birds again fly abroad. The hour has come for all light-dreading people, the vesper hour and leisure hour, when they do not- “take leisure.”</p>
<p>I hear it and smell it: it has come- their hour for hunt and procession, not indeed for a wild hunt, but for a tame, lame, snuffling, soft-treaders’, soft-prayers’ hunt,-</p>
<p>-For a hunt after susceptible simpletons: all mouse-traps for the heart have again been set! And whenever I lift a curtain, a night-moth rushes out of it.</p>
<p>Did it perhaps squat there along with another night-moth? For everywhere do I smell small concealed communities; and wherever there are closets there are new devotees therein, and the atmosphere of devotees.</p>
<p>They sit for long evenings beside one another, and say: “Let us again become like little children and say, ‘good God!’”- ruined in mouths and stomachs by the pious confectioners.</p>
<p>Or they look for long evenings at a crafty, lurking cross-spider, that preaches prudence to the spiders themselves, and teaches that “under crosses it is good for web-spinning!”</p>
<p>Or they sit all day at swamps with angle-rods, and on that account think themselves profound; but whoever fishes where there are no fish, I do not even call him superficial!</p>
<p>Or they learn in godly-gay style to play the harp with a hymn-poet, who would rather harp himself into the heart of young girls:- for he has tired of old girls and their praises.</p>
<p>Or they learn to shudder with a learned semi-madcap, who waits in darkened rooms for spirits to come to him- and the spirit runs away entirely!</p>
<p>Or they listen to an old roving howl- and growl-piper, who has learned from the sad winds the sadness of sounds; now pips he as the wind, and preaches sadness in sad strains.</p>
<p>And some of them have even become night-watchmen: they know now how to blow horns, and go about at night and awaken old things which have long fallen asleep.</p>
<p>Five words about old things did I hear last night at the garden-wall: they came from such old, sorrowful, arid night-watchmen.</p>
<p>“For a father he cares not sufficiently for his children: human fathers do this better!”-</p>
<p>“He is too old! He now cares no more for his children,”- answered the other night-watchman.</p>
<p>“Has he then children? No one can prove it unless he himself prove it! I have long wished that he would for once prove it thoroughly.”</p>
<p>“Prove? As if he had ever proved anything! Proving is difficult to him; he lays great stress on one’s believing him.”</p>
<p>“Ay! Ay! Belief saves him; belief in him. That is the way with old people! So it is with us also!”-</p>
<p>-Thus spoke to each other the two old night-watchmen and lightscarers, and tooted then sorrowfully on their horns: so did it happen last night at the garden-wall.</p>
<p>To me, however, did the heart writhe with laughter, and was like to break; it knew not where to go, and sunk into the midriff.</p>
<p>It will be my death yet- to choke with laughter when I see asses drunken, and hear night-watchmen thus doubt about God.</p>
<p>Has the time not long since passed for all such doubts? Who may nowadays awaken such old slumbering, light-shunning things!</p>
<p>With the old Deities has it long since come to an end:- and verily, a good joyful Deity-end had they!</p>
<p>They did not “twilight” themselves to death- that do people fabricate! On the contrary, they- laughed themselves to death once on a time!</p>
<p>That took place when the ungodliest utterance came from a God himself- the utterance: “There is but one God! you shall have no other gods before me!”-</p>
<p>-An old grim-beard of a God, a jealous one, forgot himself in such wise:-</p>
<p>And all the gods then laughed, and shook upon their thrones, and exclaimed: “Is it not just divinity that there are gods, but no God?”</p>
<p>He that has an ear let him hear.-</p>
<p>Thus talked Zarathustra in the city he loved, which is surnamed “The Pied Cow.” For from here he had but two days to travel to reach once more his cave and his animals; his soul, however, rejoiced unceasingly on account of the nighness of his return home.</p>

    <title>【P3C9】The Return Home</title>
    <url>/p/13147e3b/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>O solitude! My home, solitude! Too long have I lived wildly in wild remoteness, to return to you without tears!</p>
<p>Now threaten me with the finger as mothers threaten; now smile upon me as mothers smile; now say just: “Who was it that like a whirlwind once rushed away from me?-</p>
<p>-Who when departing called out: ‘Too long have I sat with solitude; there have I unlearned silence!’ That have you learned now- surely?</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>O Zarathustra, everything do I know; and that you were more forsaken amongst the many, you unique one, than you ever were with me!</p>
<p>One thing is forsakenness, another matter is solitude: that have you now learned! And that amongst men you will ever be wild and strange:</p>
<p>-Wild and strange even when they love you: for above all they want to be treated indulgently!</p>
<p>Here, however, are you at home and house with yourself; here can you utter everything, and unbosom all motives; nothing is here ashamed of concealed, congealed feelings.</p>
<p>Here do all things come caressingly to your talk and flatter you: for they want to ride upon your back. On every simile do you here ride to every truth.</p>
<p>Honestly and openly may you here talk to all things: and verily, it sounds as praise in their ears, for one to talk to all things- directly!</p>
<p>Another matter, however, is forsakenness. For, do you remember, O Zarathustra? When your bird screamed overhead, when you stood in the forest, irresolute, ignorant where to go, beside a corpse:-</p>
<p>-When you spoke: ‘Let my animals lead me! More dangerous have I found it among men than among animals:’- That was forsakenness!</p>
<p>And do you remember, O Zarathustra? When you sat in your isle, a well of wine giving and granting amongst empty buckets, giving and distributing amongst the thirsty:</p>
<p>-Until at last you alone sat thirsty amongst the drunken ones, and wailed nightly: ‘Is taking not more blessed than giving? And stealing yet more blessed than taking?’- That was forsakenness!</p>
<p>And do you remember, O Zarathustra? When your still hour came and drove you forth from yourself, when with wicked whispering it said: ‘Speak and perish!’-</p>
<p>-When it disgusted you with all your waiting and silence, and discouraged your humble courage: That was forsakenness!”-</p>
<p>O solitude! My home, solitude! How blessedly and tenderly speaks your voice to me!</p>
<p>We do not question each other, we do not complain to each other; we go together openly through open doors.</p>
<p>For all is open with you and clear; and even the hours run here on lighter feet. For in the dark, time weighs heavier upon one than in the light.</p>
<p>Here fly open to me all beings’ words and word-cabinets: here all being wants to become words, here all becoming wants to learn of me how to talk.</p>
<p>Down there, however- all talking is in vain! There, forgetting and passing-by are the best wisdom: that have I learned now!</p>
<p>He who would understand everything in man must handle everything. But for that I have too clean hands.</p>
<p>I do not like even to inhale their breath; alas! that I have lived so long among their noise and bad breaths!</p>
<p>O blessed stillness around me! O pure odours around me! How from a deep breast this stillness fetches pure breath! How it hearkens, this blessed stillness!</p>
<p>But down there- there speaks everything, there is everything misheard. If one announce one’s wisdom with bells, the shopmen in the market-place will out-jingle it with pennies!</p>
<p>Everything among them talks; no one knows any longer how to understand. Everything falls into the water; nothing falls any longer into deep wells.</p>
<p>Everything among them talks, nothing succeeds any longer and accomplishes itself. Everything cackles, but who will still sit quietly on the nest and hatch eggs?</p>
<p>Everything among them talks, everything is out-talked. And that which yesterday was still too hard for time itself and its tooth, hangs today, outchamped and outchewed, from the mouths of the men of today.</p>
<p>Everything among them talks, everything is betrayed. And what was once called the secret and secrecy of profound souls, belongs to-day to the street-trumpeters and other butterflies.</p>
<p>O human hubbub, you wonderful thing! you noise in dark streets! Now are you again behind me:- my greatest danger lies behind me!</p>
<p>In indulging and pitying lay ever my greatest danger; and all human hubbub wishes to be indulged and tolerated.</p>
<p>With suppressed truths, with fool’s hand and befooled heart, and rich in petty lies of pity:- thus have I ever lived among men.</p>
<p>Disguised did I sit amongst them, ready to misjudge myself that I might endure them, and willingly saying to myself: “You fool, you do not know men!”</p>
<p>One unlearns men when one lives amongst them: there is too much foreground in all men- what can far-seeing, far-longing eyes do there!</p>
<p>And, fool that I was, when they misjudged me, I indulged them on that account more than myself, being habitually hard on myself, and often even taking revenge on myself for the indulgence.</p>
<p>Stung all over by poisonous flies, and hollowed like the stone by many drops of wickedness: thus did I sit among them, and still said to myself: “Innocent is everything petty of its pettiness!”</p>
<p>Especially did I find those who call themselves “the good,” the most poisonous flies; they sting in all innocence, they lie in all innocence; how could they- be just towards me!</p>
<p>He who lives amongst the good- pity teaches him to lie. Pity makes stifling air for all free souls. For the stupidity of the good is unfathomable.</p>
<p>To conceal myself and my riches- that did I learn down there: for every one did I still find poor in spirit. It was the lie of my pity, that I knew in every one.</p>
<p>-That I saw and scented in every one, what was enough of spirit for him, and what was too much!</p>
<p>Their stiff wise men: I call them wise, not stiff- thus did I learn to slur over words.</p>
<p>The grave-diggers dig for themselves diseases. Under old rubbish rest bad vapors. One should not stir up the marsh. One should live on mountains.</p>
<p>With blessed nostrils do I again breathe mountain-freedom. Freed at last is my nose from the smell of all human hubbub!</p>
<p>With sharp breezes tickled, as with sparkling wine, sneezes my soulsneezes, and shouts self-congratulatingly: “Health to you!”</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P3C10】The Three Evils</title>
    <url>/p/54ff921b/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>1.</p>
<p>In my dream, in my last morning-dream, I stood today on a promontory- beyond the world; I held a pair of scales, and weighed the world.</p>
<p>Alas, that the rosy dawn came too early to me: she glowed me awake, the jealous one! Jealous is she always of the glows of my morning-dream.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Measurable by him who has time, weighable by a good weigher, attainable by strong pinions, divinable by divine nutcrackers: thus did my dream find the world:-</p>
<p>My dream, a bold sailor, half-ship, half-hurricane, silent as the butterfly, impatient as the falcon: how had it the patience and leisure to-day for world-weighing!</p>
<p>Did my wisdom perhaps speak secretly to it, my laughing, wide-awake day-wisdom, which mocks at all “infinite worlds”? For it says: “Where force is, there becomes number the master: it has more force.”</p>
<p>How confidently did my dream contemplate this finite world, not new-fangledly, not old-fangledly, not timidly, not entreatingly:-</p>
<p>-As if a big round apple presented itself to my hand, a ripe golden apple, with a coolly-soft, velvety skin:- thus did the world present itself to me:-</p>
<p>-As if a tree nodded to me, a broad-branched, strong-willed tree, curved as a recline and a foot-stool for weary travellers: thus did the world stand on my promontory:-</p>
<p>-As if delicate hands carried a casket towards me- a casket open for the delectation of modest adoring eyes: thus did the world present itself before me today:-</p>
<p>-Not riddle enough to scare human love from it, not solution enough to put to sleep human wisdom:- a humanly good thing was the world to me to-day, of which such bad things are said!</p>
<p>How I thank my morning-dream that I thus at today’s dawn, weighed the world! As a humanly good thing did it come to me, this dream and heart-comforter!</p>
<p>And that I may do the like by day, and imitate and copy its best, now will I put the three worst things on the scales, and weigh them humanly well.-</p>
<p>He who taught to bless taught also to curse: what are the three best cursed things in the world? These will I put on the scales.</p>
<p>Voluptuousness, passion for power, and selfishness: these three things have hitherto been best cursed, and have been in worst and falsest repute- these three things will I weigh humanly well.</p>
<p>Well! Here is my promontory, and there is the sea- it rolls here to me, shaggily and fawningly, the old, faithful, hundred-headed dog-monster that I love!-</p>
<p>Well! Here will I hold the scales over the weltering sea: and also a witness do I choose to look on- you, the hermit-tree, you, the strongodoured, broad-arched tree that I love!-</p>
<p>On what bridge goes the now to the hereafter? By what constraint do the high stoop to the low? And what enjoins even the highest still- to grow upwards?-</p>
<p>Now stand the scales poised and at rest: three heavy questions have I thrown in; three heavy answers carries the other scale.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>Voluptuousness: to all hair-shirted despisers of the body, a sting and stake; and, cursed as “the world,” by all the afterworldly: for it mocks and befools all erring, misinferring teachers.</p>
<p>Voluptuousness: to the rabble, the slow fire at which it is burnt; to all wormy wood, to all stinking rags, the prepared heat and stew furnace.</p>
<p>Voluptuousness: to free hearts, a thing innocent and free, the gardenhappiness of the earth, all the future’s thanks-overflow to the present.</p>
<p>Voluptuousness: only to the withered a sweet poison; to the lionwilled, however, the great cordial, and the reverently saved wine of wines.</p>
<p>Voluptuousness: the great symbolic happiness of a higher happiness and highest hope. For to many is marriage promised, and more than marriage,-</p>
<p>-To many that are more unknown to each other than man and woman:- and who has fully understood how unknown to each other are man and woman!</p>
<p>Voluptuousness:- but I will have hedges around my thoughts, and even around my words, lest swine and libertine should break into my gardens!-</p>
<p>Passion for power: the glowing scourge of the hardest of the hearthard; the cruel torture reserved for the cruel themselves; the gloomy flame of living pyres.</p>
<p>Passion for power: the wicked gadfly which is mounted on the vainest peoples; the scorner of all uncertain virtue; which rides on every horse and on every pride.</p>
<p>Passion for power: the earthquake which breaks and upbreaks all that is rotten and hollow; the rolling, rumbling, punitive demolisher of whited sepulchres; the flashing interrogative-sign beside premature answers.</p>
<p>Passion for power: before whose glance man creeps and crouches and drudges, and becomes lower than the serpent and the swine:- until at last great contempt cries out of him-,</p>
<p>Passion for power: the terrible teacher of great contempt, which preaches to their face to cities and empires: “Away with you!”- until a voice cries out of themselves: “Away with me!”</p>
<p>Passion for power: which, however, mounts alluringly even to the pure and lonesome, and up to self-satisfied elevations, glowing like a love that paints purple felicities alluringly on earthly heavens.</p>
<p>Passion for power: but who would call it passion, when the height longs to stoop for power! nothing sick or diseased is there in such longing and descending!</p>
<p>That the lonesome height may not forever remain lonesome and selfsufficing; that the mountains may come to the valleys and the winds of the heights to the plains:-</p>
<p>Oh, who could find the right prenomen and honoring name for such longing! “Giving virtue”- thus did Zarathustra. Once name the unnamable.</p>
<p>And then it happened also,- and verily, it happened for the first time!that his word blessed selfishness, the wholesome, healthy selfishness, that springs from the powerful soul:-</p>
<p>-From the powerful soul, to which the high body appertains, the handsome, triumphing, refreshing body, around which everything becomes a mirror:</p>
<p>-The pliant, persuasive body, the dancer, whose symbol and epitome is the self-enjoying soul. Of such bodies and souls the self-enjoyment calls itself “virtue.”</p>
<p>With its words of good and bad does such self-enjoyment shelter itself as with sacred groves; with the names of its happiness does it banish from itself everything contemptible.</p>
<p>Away from itself does it banish everything cowardly; it says: “Badthat is cowardly!” Contemptible seem to it the ever-solicitous, the sighing, the complaining, and whoever pick up the most trifling advantage.</p>
<p>It despises also all bitter-sweet wisdom: for verily, there is also wisdom that blooms in the dark, a night-shade wisdom, which ever sighs: “All is vain!”</p>
<p>Shy distrust is regarded by it as base, and every one who wants oaths instead of looks and hands: also all over-distrustful wisdom,- for such is the mode of cowardly souls.</p>
<p>Baser still it regards the obsequious, doggish one, who immediately lies on his back, the submissive one; and there is also wisdom that is submissive, and doggish, and pious, and obsequious.</p>
<p>Hateful to it altogether, and a loathing, is he who will never defend himself, he who swallows down poisonous spittle and bad looks, the alltoo-patient one, the all-endurer, the all-satisfied one: for that is the mode of slaves.</p>
<p>Whether they be servile before gods and divine spurnings, or before men and stupid human opinions: at all kinds of slaves does it spit, this blessed selfishness!</p>
<p>Bad: thus does it call all that is spirit-broken, and sordidly-servile- constrained, blinking eyes, depressed hearts, and the false submissive style, which kisses with broad cowardly lips.</p>
<p>And spurious wisdom: so does it call all the wit that slaves, and hoaryheaded and weary ones affect; and especially all the cunning, spuriouswitted, curious-witted foolishness of priests!</p>
<p>The spurious wise, however, all the priests, the world-weary, and those whose souls are of feminine and servile nature- oh, how has their game all along abused selfishness!</p>
<p>And precisely that was to be virtue and was to be called virtue- to abuse selfishness! And “selfless”- so did they wish themselves with good reason, all those world-weary cowards and cross-spiders!</p>
<p>But to all those comes now the day, the change, the sword of judgment, the great noontide: then shall many things be revealed!</p>
<p>And he who proclaims the ego wholesome and sacred, and selfishness blessed, verily, he, the prognosticator, speaks also what he knows: “Behold, it comes, it is night, the great noontide!”</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P3C11】The Spirit of Gravity</title>
    <url>/p/64591ccf/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>1.</p>
<p>MY MOUTHPIECE- is of the people: too coarsely and cordially do I talk for Angora rabbits. And still stranger sounds my word to all ink-fish and pen-foxes.</p>
<p>My hand- is a fool’s hand: woe to all tables and walls, and whatever has room for fool’s sketching, fool’s scrawling!</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>My foot- is a horse-foot; therewith do I trample and trot over stick and stone, in the fields up and down, and am bedevilled with delight in all fast racing.</p>
<p>My stomach- is surely an eagle’s stomach? For it preferrs lamb’s flesh. Certainly it is a bird’s stomach.</p>
<p>Nourished with innocent things, and with few, ready and impatient to fly, to fly away- that is now my nature: why should there not be something of bird-nature therein!</p>
<p>And especially that I am hostile to the spirit of gravity, that is birdnature:- verily, deadly hostile, supremely hostile, originally hostile! Oh, where has my hostility not flown and misflown!</p>
<p>Thereof could I sing a song- - and will sing it: though I be alone in an empty house, and must sing it to my own ears.</p>
<p>Other singers are there, to be sure, to whom only the full house makes the voice soft, the hand eloquent, the eye expressive, the heart wakeful:those do I not resemble.-</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>He who one day teaches men to fly will have shifted all landmarks; to him will all landmarks themselves fly into the air; the earth will he christen anew- as “the light body.”</p>
<p>The ostrich runs faster than the fastest horse, but it also thrusts its head heavily into the heavy earth: thus is it with the man who cannot yet fly.</p>
<p>Heavy to him are earth and life, and so wills the spirit of gravity! But he who would become light, and be a bird, must love himself:- thus do I teach.</p>
<p>Not, to be sure, with the love of the side and infected, for with them stinks even self-love!</p>
<p>One must learn to love oneself- thus do I teach- with a wholesome and healthy love: that one may endure to be with oneself, and not go roving about.</p>
<p>Such roving about christens itself “brotherly love”; with these words has there hitherto been the best lying and dissembling, and especially by those who have been burdensome to every one.</p>
<p>And verily, it is no commandment for today and tomorrow to learn to love oneself. Rather is it of all arts the finest, subtlest, last and patientest.</p>
<p>For to its possessor is all possession well concealed, and of all treasurepits one’s own is last excavated- so causes the spirit of gravity.</p>
<p>Almost in the cradle are we apportioned with heavy words and worths: “good” and “evil”- so calls itself this dowry. For the sake of it we are forgiven for living.</p>
<p>And therefore suffers one little children to come to one, to forbid them betimes to love themselves- so causes the spirit of gravity.</p>
<p>And we- we bear loyally what is apportioned to us, on hard shoulders, over rugged mountains! And when we sweat, then do people say to us: “Yes, life is hard to bear!”</p>
<p>But man himself only is hard to bear! The reason thereof is that he carries too many extraneous things on his shoulders. Like the camel kneels he down, and lets himself be well laden.</p>
<p>Especially the strong load-bearing man in whom reverence resides. Too many extraneous heavy words and worths loads he upon himselfthen seems life to him a desert!</p>
<p>And verily! Many a thing also that is our own is hard to bear! And many internal things in man are like the oyster- repulsive and slippery and hard to grasp;-</p>
<p>So that an elegant shell, with elegant adornment, must plead for them. But this art also must one learn: to have a shell, and a fine appearance, and sagacious blindness!</p>
<p>Again, it deceives about many things in man, that many a shell is poor and pitiable, and too much of a shell. Much concealed goodness and power is never dreamt of; the choicest dainties find no tasters!</p>
<p>Women know that, the choicest of them: a little fatter a little leaner- oh, how much fate is in so little!</p>
<p>Man is difficult to discover, and to himself most difficult of all; often lies the spirit concerning the soul. So causes the spirit of gravity.</p>
<p>He, however, has discovered himself who says: This is my good and evil: therewith has he silenced the mole and the dwarf, who say: “Good for all, evil for all.”</p>
<p>Neither do I like those who call everything good, and this world the best of all. Those do I call the all-satisfied.</p>
<p>All-satisfiedness, which knows how to taste everything,- that is not the best taste! I honor the refractory, fastidious tongues and stomachs, which have learned to say “I” and “Yes” and “No.”</p>
<p>To chew and digest everything, however- that is the genuine swinenature! Ever to say you-A- that has only the ass learned, and those like it!-</p>
<p>Deep yellow and hot red- so wants my taste- it mixes blood with all colors. Yet he who whitewashes his house, betrays to me a whitewashed soul.</p>
<p>With mummies, some fall in love; others with phantoms: both alike hostile to all flesh and blood- oh, how repugnant are both to my taste! For I love blood.</p>
<p>And there will I not reside and abide where every one spits and spews: that is now my taste,- rather would I live amongst thieves and perjurers. Nobody carries gold in his mouth.</p>
<p>Still more repugnant to me, however, are all lick-spittles; and the most repugnant animal of man that I found, did I christen “parasite”: it would not love, and would yet live by love.</p>
<p>Unhappy do I call all those who have only one choice: either to become evil beasts, or evil beast-tamers. Amongst such would I not build my tabernacle.</p>
<p>Unhappy do I also call those who have ever to wait,- they are repugnant to my taste- all the toll-gatherers and traders, and kings, and other landkeepers and shopkeepers.</p>
<p>I learned waiting also, and thoroughly so,- but only waiting for myself. And above all did I learn standing and walking and running and leaping and climbing and dancing.</p>
<p>This however is my teaching: he who wishes one day to fly, must first learn standing and walking and running and climbing and dancing:- one does not fly into flying!</p>
<p>With rope-ladders learned I to reach many a window, with nimble legs did I climb high masts: to sit on high masts of perception seemed to me no small bliss;-</p>
<p>-To flicker like small flames on high masts: a small light, certainly, but a great comfort to cast-away sailors and ship-wrecked ones!</p>
<p>By divers ways and wendings did I arrive at my truth; not by one ladder did I mount to the height where my eye roves into my remoteness.</p>
<p>And unwillingly only did I ask my way- that was always counter to my taste! Rather did I question and test the ways themselves.</p>
<p>A testing and a questioning has been all my travelling:- and verily, one must also learn to answer such questioning! That, however,- is my taste:</p>
<p>-Neither a good nor a bad taste, but my taste, of which I have no longer either shame or secrecy.</p>
<p>“This- is now my way,- where is yours?” Thus did I answer those who asked me “the way.” For the way- it does not exist!</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>

    <title>【P3C12】Old and New Tablets</title>
    <url>/p/1fbdeb1a/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>1.</p>
<p>Here do I sit and wait, old broken law-tablets around me and also new half-written law-tablets. When comes my hour?</p>
<p>-The hour of my descent, of my down-going: for once more will I go to men.</p>
<p>For that hour do I now wait: for first must the signs come to me that it is my hour- namely, the laughing lion with the flock of doves.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Meanwhile do I talk to myself as one who has time. No one tells me anything new, so I tell myself my own story.</p>
<p>2.</p>
<p>When I came to men, then found I them resting on an old infatuation: all of them thought they had long known what was good and bad for men.</p>
<p>An old wearisome business seemed to them all talk of virtue; and he who wished to sleep well spoke of “good” and “bad” before retiring to rest.</p>
<p>This somnolence did I disturb when I taught that no one yet knows what is good and bad:- unless it be the creator!</p>
<p>-It is he, however, who creates man’s goal, and gives to the earth its meaning and its future: he only effects it that anything is good or bad.</p>
<p>And I bade them upset their old academic chairs, and wherever that old infatuation had sat; I bade them laugh at their great moralists, their saints, their poets, and their saviours.</p>
<p>At their gloomy sages did I bid them laugh, and whoever had sat admonishing as a black scarecrow on the tree of life.</p>
<p>On their great grave-highway did I seat myself, and even beside the carrion and vultures- and I laughed at all their bygone and its mellow decaying glory.</p>
<p>Like penitential preachers and fools did I cry wrath and shame on all their greatness and smallness. Oh, that their best is so very small! Oh, that their worst is so very small! Thus did I laugh.</p>
<p>Thus did my wise longing, born in the mountains, cry and laugh in me; a wild wisdom, verily!- my great pinion-rustling longing.</p>
<p>And oft did it carry me off and up and away and in the midst of laughter; then flew I quivering like an arrow with sun-intoxicated rapture:</p>
<p>-Out into distant futures, which no dream has yet seen, into warmer souths than ever sculptor conceived,- where gods in their dancing are ashamed of all clothes:</p>
<p>(That I may speak in parables and halt and stammer like the poets: and verily I am ashamed that I have still to be a poet!)</p>
<p>Where all becoming seemed to me dancing of gods, and wantoning of gods, and the world unloosed and unbridled and fleeing back to itself:-</p>
<p>-As an eternal self-fleeing and re-seeking of one another of many gods, as the blessed self-contradicting, recommuning, and refraternising with one another of many gods:-</p>
<p>Where all time seemed to me a blessed mockery of moments, where necessity was freedom itself, which played happily with the goad of freedom:-</p>
<p>Where I also found again my old devil and arch-enemy, the spirit of gravity, and all that it created: constraint, law, necessity and consequence and purpose and will and good and evil:-</p>
<p>For must there not be that which is danced over, danced beyond? Must there not, for the sake of the nimble, the nimblest,- be moles and clumsy dwarfs?-</p>
<p>3.</p>
<p>There was it also where I picked up from the path the word “Superman,” and that man is something that must be overcome.</p>
<p>-That man is a bridge and not a goal- rejoicing over his noontides and evenings, as advances to new rosy dawns:</p>
<p>-The Zarathustra word of the great noontide, and whatever else I have hung up over men like purple evening-afterglows.</p>
<p>Also new stars did I make them see, along with new nights; and over cloud and day and night, did I spread out laughter like a gay-colored canopy.</p>
<p>I taught them all my poetisation and aspiration: to compose and collect into unity what is fragment in man, and riddle and fearful chance;-</p>
<p>-As composer, riddle-reader, and redeemer of chance, did I teach them to create the future, and all that has been- to redeem by creating.</p>
<p>The past of man to redeem, and every “It was” to transform, until the Will says: “But so did I will it! So shall I will it-“</p>
<p>-This did I call redemption; this alone taught I them to call redemption.- Now do I await my redemption- that I may go to them for the last time.</p>
<p>For once more will I go to men: amongst them will my sun set; in dying will I give them my choicest gift!</p>
<p>From the sun did I learn this, when it goes down, the exuberant one: gold does it then pour into the sea, out of inexhaustible riches,-</p>
<p>-So that the poorest fisherman rows even with golden oars! For this did I once see, and did not tire of weeping in beholding it.- Like the sun will also Zarathustra go down: now sits he here and waits, old broken law-tablets around him, and also new law-tablets- halfwritten.</p>
<p>4.</p>
<p>Behold, here is a new table; but where are my brothers who will carry it with me to the valley and into hearts of flesh?-</p>
<p>Thus demands my great love to the remotest ones: be not considerate of your neighbor! Man is something that must be overcome.</p>
<p>There are many divers ways and modes of overcoming: see you thereto! But only a fool thinks: “man can also be overleapt.”</p>
<p>Overcome yourself even in your neighbor: and a right which you can seize upon, shall you not allow to be given you!</p>
<p>What you do can no one do to you again. Lo, there is no requital.</p>
<p>He who cannot command himself shall obey. And many a one can command himself, but still sorely lacks self-obedience!</p>
<p>5.</p>
<p>Thus wishes the type of noble souls: they desire to have nothing gratuitously, least of all, life.</p>
<p>He who is of the rabble wishes to live gratuitously; we others, however, to whom life has given itself- we are ever considering what we can best give in return!</p>
<p>And verily, it is a noble dictum which says: “What life promises us, that promise will we keep- to life!”</p>
<p>One should not wish to enjoy where one does not contribute to the enjoyment. And one should not wish to enjoy!</p>
<p>For enjoyment and innocence are the most bashful things. Neither like to be sought for. One should have them,- but one should rather seek for guilt and pain!-</p>
<p>6.</p>
<p>O my brothers, he who is a firstling is ever sacrificed. Now, however, are we firstlings!</p>
<p>We all bleed on secret sacrificial altars, we all burn and broil in honor of ancient idols.</p>
<p>Our best is still young: this excites old palates. Our flesh is tender, our skin is only lambs’ skin:- how could we not excite old idol-priests!</p>
<p>In ourselves dwells he still, the old idol-priest, who broils our best for his banquet. Ah, my brothers, how could firstlings fail to be sacrifices!</p>
<p>But so wishes our type; and I love those who do not wish to preserve themselves, the down-going ones do I love with my entire love: for they go beyond.-</p>
<p>7.</p>
<p>To be true- that can few be! And he who can, will not! Least of all, however, can the good be true.</p>
<p>Oh, those good ones! Good men never speak the truth. For the spirit, thus to be good, is a malady.</p>
<p>They yield, those good ones, they submit themselves; their heart repeats, their soul obeys: yet he who obeys, does not listen to himself!</p>
<p>All that is called evil by the good, must come together in order that one truth may be born. O my brothers, are you also evil enough for this truth?</p>
<p>The daring venture, the prolonged distrust, the cruel No, the tedium, the cutting-into-the-quick- how seldom do these come together! Out of such seed, however- is truth produced!</p>
<p>Beside the bad conscience has hitherto grown all knowledge! Break up, break up, you discerning ones, the old law-tablets!</p>
<p>8.</p>
<p>When the water has planks, when gangways and railings o’erspan the stream, verily, he is not believed who then says: “All is in flux.”</p>
<p>But even the simpletons contradict him. “What?” say the simpletons, “all in flux? Planks and railings are still over the stream!</p>
<p>“Over the stream all is stable, all the values of things, the bridges and bearings, all ‘good’ and ‘evil’: these are all stable!”-</p>
<p>Comes, however, the hard winter, the stream-tamer, then learn even the wittiest distrust, and verily, not only the simpletons then say: “Should not everything- stand still?”</p>
<p>“Fundamentally stands everything still”- that is an appropriate winter doctrine, good cheer for an unproductive period, a great comfort for winter-sleepers and fireside-loungers.</p>
<p>“Fundamentally stands everything still”-: but contrary thereto, preaches the thawing wind!</p>
<p>The thawing wind, a bullock, which is no ploughing bullock- a furious bullock, a destroyer, which with angry horns breaks the ice! The ice however- - breaks gangways!</p>
<p>O my brothers, is not everything at present in flux? Have not all railings and gangways fallen into the water? Who would still hold on to “good” and “evil”?</p>
<p>“Woe to us! Hail to us! The thawing wind blows!”- Thus preach, my brothers, through all the streets!</p>
<p>9.</p>
<p>There is an old illusion- it is called good and evil. Around soothsayers and astrologers has hitherto revolved the orbit of this illusion.</p>
<p>Once did one believe in soothsayers and astrologers; and therefore did one believe, “Everything is fate: you shall, for you must!”</p>
<p>Then again did one distrust all soothsayers and astrologers; and therefore did one believe, “Everything is freedom: you can, for you will!”</p>
<p>O my brothers, concerning the stars and the future there has hitherto been only illusion, and not knowledge; and therefore concerning good and evil there has hitherto been only illusion and not knowledge!</p>
<p>10.</p>
<p>“You shall not rob! you shall not kill!”- such precepts were once called sacred; before them did one bow the knee and the head, and take off one’s shoes.</p>
<p>But I ask you: Where have there ever been better robbers and killers in the world than such sacred precepts?</p>
<p>Is there not even in all life- robbing and killing? And for such precepts to be called sacred, was not truth itself thereby- slain?</p>
<p>-Or was it a sermon of death that called sacred what contradicted and dissuaded from life?- O my brothers, break up, break up for me the old law-tablets!</p>
<p>11.</p>
<p>It is my sympathy with all the past that I see it is abandoned,-</p>
<p>-Abandoned to the favor, the spirit and the madness of every generation that comes, and reinterprets all that has been as its bridge!</p>
<p>A great potentate might arise, an artful prodigy, who with approval and disapproval could strain and constrain all the past, until it became for him a bridge, a harbinger, a herald, and a cock-crowing.</p>
<p>This however is the other danger, and my other sympathy:- he who is of the rabble, his thoughts go back to his grandfather,- with his grandfather, however, does time cease.</p>
<p>Thus is all the past abandoned: for it might some day happen for the rabble to become master, and drown all time in shallow waters.</p>
<p>Therefore, O my brothers, a new nobility is needed, which shall be the adversary of all rabble and potentate rule, and shall inscribe anew the word “noble” on new law-tablets.</p>
<p>For many noble ones are needed, and many kinds of noble ones, for a new nobility! Or, as I once said in parable: “That is just divinity, that there are gods, but no God!”</p>
<p>12.</p>
<p>O my brothers, I consecrate you and point you to a new nobility: you shall become procreators and cultivators and sowers of the future;-</p>
<p>-not to a nobility which you could purchase like traders with traders’ gold; for little worth is all that has its price.</p>
<p>Let it not be your honor henceforth whence you come, but where you go! Your Will and your feet which seek to overcome you- let these be your new honor!</p>
<p>Not that you have served a prince- of what account are princes now!nor that you have become a bulwark to that which stands, that it may stand more firmly.</p>
<p>Not that your family have become courtly at courts, and that you have learned- gay-colored, like the flamingo- to stand long hours in shallow pools:</p>
<p>(For ability-to-stand is a merit in courtiers; and all courtiers believe that to blessedness after death pertains- permission-to-sit!)</p>
<p>Nor even that a Spirit called Holy, led your forefathers into promised lands, which I do not praise: for where the worst of all trees grew- the cross,- in that land there is nothing to praise!-</p>
<p>-And verily, wherever this “Holy Spirit” led its knights, always in such campaigns did- goats and geese, and wry-heads and guy-heads run foremost!-</p>
<p>O my brothers, not backward shall your nobility gaze, but outward! Exiles shall you be from all fatherlands and forefather-lands!</p>
<p>Your children’s land shall you love: let this love be your new nobility,the undiscovered in the remotest seas! For it do I bid your sails search and search!</p>
<p>To your children shall you make amends for being the children of your fathers: all the past shall you thus redeem! This new table do I place over you!</p>
<p>13.</p>
<p>“Why should one live? All is vain! To live- that is to thresh straw; to livethat is to burn oneself and yet not get warm.-</p>
<p>Such ancient babbling still passes for “wisdom”; because it is old, however, and smells mustily, therefore is it the more honored. Even mould ennobles.-</p>
<p>Children might thus speak: they shun the fire because it has burnt them! There is much childishness in the old books of wisdom.</p>
<p>And he who ever “threshes straw,” why should he be allowed to rail at threshing! Such a fool one would have to muzzle!</p>
<p>Such persons sit down to the table and bring nothing with them, not even good hunger:- and then do they rail: “All is vain!”</p>
<p>But to eat and drink well, my brothers, is verily no vain art! Break up, break up for me the law-tablets of the never-joyous ones!</p>
<p>14.</p>
<p>“To the clean are all things clean”- thus say the people. I, however, say to you: To the swine all things become swinish!</p>
<p>Therefore preach the visionaries and bowed-heads (whose hearts are also bowed down): “The world itself is a filthy monster.”</p>
<p>For these are all unclean spirits; especially those, however, who have no peace or rest, unless they see the world from the backside- the afterworldly!</p>
<p>To those do I say it to the face, although it sound unpleasantly: the world resembles man, in that it has a backside,- so much is true!</p>
<p>There is in the world much filth: so much is true! But the world itself is not therefore a filthy monster!</p>
<p>There is wisdom in the fact that much in the world smells badly: loathing itself creates wings, and fountain-divining powers!</p>
<p>In the best there is still something to loathe; and the best is still something that must be overcome!-</p>
<p>O my brothers, there is much wisdom in the fact that much filth is in the world!-</p>
<p>15.</p>
<p>Such sayings did I hear pious afterworldly speak to their consciences, and verily without wickedness or guile,- although there is nothing more guileful in the world, or more wicked.</p>
<p>“Let the world be as it is! Raise not a finger against it!”</p>
<p>“Let whoever will choke and stab and skin and scrape the people: raise not a finger against it! Thereby will they learn to renounce the world.”</p>
<p>“And your own reason- this shall you yourself stifle and choke; for it is a reason of this world,- thereby will you learn yourself to renounce the world.”-</p>
<p>-Shatter, shatter, O my brothers, those old law-tablets of the pious! Tatter the maxims of the world-maligners!-</p>
<p>16.</p>
<p>“He who learns much unlearns all violent cravings”- that do people now whisper to one another in all the dark lanes.</p>
<p>“Wisdom wearies, nothing is worth while; you shall not crave!”- this new table found I hanging even in the public markets.</p>
<p>Break up for me, O my brothers, break up also that new table! The weary-o’-the-world put it up, and the preachers of death and the jailer: for lo, it is also a sermon for slavery:-</p>
<p>Because they learned badly and not the best, and everything too early and everything too fast; because they ate badly: from thence has resulted their ruined stomach;-</p>
<p>-For a ruined stomach, is their spirit: it persuades to death! For verily, my brothers, the spirit is a stomach!</p>
<p>Life is a well of delight, but to him in whom the ruined stomach speaks, the father of affliction, all fountains are poisoned.</p>
<p>To discern: that is delight to the lion-willed! But he who has become weary, is himself merely “willed”; with him play all the waves.</p>
<p>And such is always the nature of weak men: they lose themselves on their way. And at last asks their weariness: “Why did we ever go on the way? All is indifferent!”</p>
<p>To them sounds it pleasant to have preached in their ears: “Nothing is worth while! You shall not will!” That, however, is a sermon for slavery.</p>
<p>O my brothers, a fresh blustering wind comes Zarathustra to all wayweary ones; many noses will he yet make sneeze!</p>
<p>Even through walls blows my free breath, and into prisons and imprisoned spirits!</p>
<p>Willing emancipates: for willing is creating: so do I teach. And only for creating shall you learn!</p>
<p>And also the learning shall you learn only from me, the learning well!He who has ears let him hear!</p>
<p>17.</p>
<p>There stands the boat- there goes it over, perhaps into vast nothingnessbut who wills to enter into this “Perhaps”?</p>
<p>None of you want to enter into the death-boat! How should you then be world-weary ones!</p>
<p>World-weary ones! And have not even withdrawn from the earth! Eager did I ever find you for the earth, amorous still of your own earthweariness!</p>
<p>Not in vain does your lip hang down:- a small worldly wish still sits on it! And in your eye- floats there not a little cloud of unforgotten earthly bliss?</p>
<p>There are on the earth many good inventions, some useful, some pleasant: for their sake is the earth to be loved.</p>
<p>And many such good inventions are there, that they are like woman’s breasts: useful at the same time, and pleasant.</p>
<p>You world-weary ones, however! You earth-idlers! You, shall one beat with stripes! With stripes shall one again make you sprightly limbs.</p>
<p>For if you be not invalids, or decrepit creatures, of whom the earth is weary, then are you sly sloths, or dainty, sneaking pleasure-cats. And if you will not again run gaily, then shall you- pass away!</p>
<p>To the incurable shall one not seek to be a physician: thus teaches Zarathustra:- so shall you pass away!</p>
<p>But more courage is needed to make an end than to make a new verse: that do all physicians and poets know well.-</p>
<p>18.</p>
<p>O my brothers, there are law-tablets which weariness framed, and lawtablets which slothfulness framed, corrupt slothfulness: although they speak similarly, they want to be heard differently.-</p>
<p>See this languishing one! Only a span-breadth is he from his goal; but from weariness has he lain down obstinately in the dust, this brave one!</p>
<p>From weariness yawns he at the path, at the earth, at the goal, and at himself: not a step further will he go,- this brave one!</p>
<p>Now glows the sun upon him, and the dogs lick at his sweat: but he lies there in his obstinacy and preferrs to languish:-</p>
<p>-A span-breadth from his goal, to languish! you will have to drag him into his heaven by the hair of his head- this hero!</p>
<p>Better still that you let him lie where he has lain down, that sleep may come to him, the comforter, with cooling patter-rain.</p>
<p>Let him lie, until of his own accord he awakens,- until of his own accord he repudiates all weariness, and what weariness has taught through him!</p>
<p>Only, my brothers, see that you scare the dogs away from him, the idle skulkers, and all the swarming vermin:-</p>
<p>-All the swarming vermin of the “cultured,” that- feast on the sweat of every hero!-</p>
<p>19.</p>
<p>I form circles around me and sacred boundaries; ever fewer ascend with me ever higher mountains: I build a mountain-range out of ever holier mountains.-</p>
<p>But wherever you would ascend with me, O my brothers, take care lest a parasite ascend with you!</p>
<p>A parasite: that is a reptile, a creeping, cringing reptile, that tries to fatten on your infirm and sore places.</p>
<p>And this is its art: it divines where ascending souls are weary, in your trouble and dejection, in your sensitive modesty, does it build its loathsome nest.</p>
<p>Where the strong are weak, where the noble are all-too-gentle- there builds it its loathsome nest; the parasite lives where the great have small sore-places.</p>
<p>What is the highest of all species of being, and what is the lowest? The parasite is the lowest species; yet he who is of the highest species feeds most parasites.</p>
<p>For the soul which has the longest ladder, and can go deepest down: how could there fail to be most parasites upon it?-</p>
<p>-The most comprehensive soul, which can run and stray and rove furthest in itself; the most necessary soul, which out of joy flings itself into chance:-</p>
<p>-The soul in Being, which plunges into Becoming; the possessing soul, which seeks to attain desire and longing:-</p>
<p>-The soul fleeing from itself, which overtakes itself in the widest circuit; the wisest soul, to which folly speaks most sweetly:-</p>
<p>-The soul most self-loving, in which all things have their current and counter-current, their ebb and their flow:- oh, how could the loftiest soul fail to have the worst parasites?</p>
<p>20.</p>
<p>O my brothers, am I then cruel? But I say: What falls, that shall one also push!</p>
<p>Everything of today- it falls, it decays; who would preserve it! But I- I wish also to push it!</p>
<p>Know you the delight which rolls stones into precipitous depths?Those men of today, see just how they roll into my depths!</p>
<p>A prelude am I to better players, O my brothers! An example! Do according to my example!</p>
<p>And him whom you do not teach to fly, teach I pray you- to fall faster!-</p>
<p>21.</p>
<p>I love the brave: but it is not enough to be a swordsman,- one must also know whereon to use swordsmanship!</p>
<p>And often is it greater bravery to keep quiet and pass by, that thereby one may reserve oneself for a worthier foe!</p>
<p>You shall only have foes to be hated; but not foes to be despised: you must be proud of your foes. Thus have I already taught.</p>
<p>For the worthier foe, O my brothers, shall you reserve yourselves: therefore must you pass by many a one,-</p>
<p>-Especially many of the rabble, who din your ears with noise about people and peoples.</p>
<p>Keep your eye clear of their For and Against! There is there much right, much wrong: he who looks on becomes wroth.</p>
<p>Therein viewing, therein hewing- they are the same thing: therefore depart into the forests and lay your sword to sleep!</p>
<p>Go your ways! and let the people and peoples go theirs!- gloomy ways, verily, on which not a single hope glints any more!</p>
<p>Let there the trader rule, where all that still glitters is- traders’ gold. It is the time of kings no longer: that which now calls itself the people is unworthy of kings.</p>
<p>See how these peoples themselves now do just like the traders: they pick up the small advantage out of all kinds of rubbish!</p>
<p>They lay lures for one another, they lure things out of one another,that they call “good neighborliness.” O blessed remote period when a people said to itself: “I will be- master over peoples!”</p>
<p>For, my brothers, the best shall rule, the best also wills to rule! And where the teaching is different, there- the best is lacking.</p>
<p>22.</p>
<p>If they had- bread for nothing, alas! for what would they cry! Their maintainment- that is their true entertainment; and they shall have it hard!</p>
<p>Beasts of prey, are they: in their “working”- there is even plundering, in their “earning”- there is even over-reaching! Therefore shall they have it hard!</p>
<p>Better beasts of prey shall they thus become, subtler, cleverer, more man-like: for man is the best beast of prey.</p>
<p>All the animals has man already robbed of their virtues: that is why of all animals it has been hardest for man.</p>
<p>Only the birds are still beyond him. And if man should yet learn to fly, alas! to what height- would his rapacity fly!</p>
<p>23.</p>
<p>Thus would I have man and woman: fit for war, the one; fit for maternity, the other; both, however, fit for dancing with head and legs.</p>
<p>And lost be the day to us in which a measure has not been danced. And false be every truth which has not had laughter along with it!</p>
<p>24.</p>
<p>Your marriage-arranging: see that it be not a bad arranging! You have arranged too hastily: so there follows therefrom- marriage-breaking!</p>
<p>And better marriage-breaking than marriage-bending, marriage-lying!- Thus spoke a woman to me: “Indeed, I broke the marriage, but first did the marriage break- me!</p>
<p>The badly paired found I ever the most revengeful: they make every one suffer for it that they no longer run singly.</p>
<p>On that account want I the honest ones to say to one another: “We love each other: let us see to it that we maintain our love! Or shall our pledging be blundering?”</p>
<p>-“Give us a set term and a small marriage, that we may see if we are fit for the great marriage! It is a great matter always to be twain.”</p>
<p>Thus do I counsel all honest ones; and what would be my love to the Superman, and to all that is to come, if I should counsel and speak otherwise!</p>
<p>Not only to propagate yourselves onwards but upwards- thereto, O my brothers, may the garden of marriage help you!</p>
<p>25.</p>
<p>He who has grown wise concerning old origins, lo, he will at last seek after the fountains of the future and new origins.-</p>
<p>O my brothers, not long will it be until new peoples shall arise and new fountains shall rush down into new depths.</p>
<p>For the earthquake- it chokes up many wells, it causes much languishing: but it brings also to light inner powers and secrets.</p>
<p>The earthquake discloses new fountains. In the earthquake of old peoples new fountains burst forth.</p>
<p>And whoever calls out: “Lo, here is a well for many thirsty ones, one heart for many longing ones, one will for many instruments”:- around him collects a people, that is to say, many attempting ones.</p>
<p>Who can command, who must obey- that is there attempted! Ah, with what long seeking and solving and failing and learning and reattempting!</p>
<p>Human society: it is an attempt- so I teach- a long seeking: it seeks however the ruler!-</p>
<p>-An attempt, my brothers! And no “contract”! Destroy, I pray you, destroy that word of the soft-hearted and half-and-half!</p>
<p>26.</p>
<p>O my brothers! With whom lies the greatest danger to the whole human future? Is it not with the good and just?-</p>
<p>-As those who say and feel in their hearts: “We already know what is good and just, we possess it also; woe to those who still seek thereafter!</p>
<p>And whatever harm the wicked may do, the harm of the good is the harmfulest harm!</p>
<p>And whatever harm the world-maligners may do, the harm of the good is the harmfulest harm!</p>
<p>O my brothers, into the hearts of the good and just looked some one once on a time, who said: “They are the Pharisees.” But people did not understand him.</p>
<p>The good and just themselves were not free to understand him; their spirit was imprisoned in their good conscience. The stupidity of the good is unfathomably wise.</p>
<p>It is the truth, however, that the good must be Pharisees- they have no choice!</p>
<p>The good must crucify him who creates his own virtue! That is the truth!</p>
<p>The second one, however, who discovered their country- the country, heart and soil of the good and just,- it was he who asked: “Whom do they hate most?” The creator, hate they most, him who breaks the law-tablets and old values, the breaker,- him they call the law-breaker.</p>
<p>For the good- they cannot create; they are always the beginning of the end:-</p>
<p>-They crucify him who writes new values on new law-tablets, they sacrifice to themselves the future- they crucify the whole human future!</p>
<p>The good- they have always been the beginning of the end.-</p>
<p>27.</p>
<p>O my brothers, have you also understood this word? And what I once said of the “last man”?- -</p>
<p>With whom lies the greatest danger to the whole human future? Is it not with the good and just?</p>
<p>Break up, break up, I pray you, the good and just!- O my brothers, have you understood also this word?</p>
<p>28.</p>
<p>You flee from me? You are frightened? You tremble at this word?</p>
<p>O my brothers, when I enjoined you to break up the good, and the law-tablets of the good, then only did I embark man on his high seas.</p>
<p>And now only comes to him the great terror, the great outlook, the great sickness, the great nausea, the great seasickness.</p>
<p>False shores and false securities did the good teach you; in the lies of the good were you born and bred. Everything has been radically contorted and distorted by the good.</p>
<p>But he who discovered the country of “man,” discovered also the country of “man’s future.” Now shall you be sailors for me, brave, patient!</p>
<p>Keep yourselves up betimes, my brothers, learn to keep yourselves up! The sea storms: many seek to raise themselves again by you.</p>
<p>The sea storms: all is in the sea. Well! Cheer up! You old seamanhearts!</p>
<p>What of fatherland! There strives our helm where our children’s land is! Therewards, stormier than the sea, storms our great longing!-</p>
<p>29.</p>
<p>“Why so hard!”- said to the diamond one day the charcoal; “are we then not near relatives?”-</p>
<p>Why so soft? O my brothers; thus do I ask you: are you then not- my brothers?</p>
<p>Why so soft, so submissive and yielding? Why is there so much negation and abnegation in your hearts? Why is there so little fate in your looks?</p>
<p>And if you will not be fates and inexorable ones, how can you one day- conquer with me?</p>
<p>And if your hardness will not glance and cut and chip to pieces, how can you one day- create with me?</p>
<p>For the creators are hard. And blessed must it seem to you to press your hand upon millenniums as upon wax,-</p>
<p>-Blessed to write upon the will of millenniums as upon brass,- harder than brass, nobler than brass. Entirely hard is only the noblest.</p>
<p>This new table, O my brothers, put I up over you: Become hard!-</p>
<p>30.</p>
<p>O you, my Will! you change of every need, my needfulness! Preserve me from all small victories!</p>
<p>You fatedness of my soul, which I call fate! you In-me! Over-me! Preserve and spare me for one great fate!</p>
<p>And your last greatness, my Will, spare it for your last- that you may be inexorable in your victory! Ah, who has not perished to his victory!</p>
<p>Ah, whose eye has not bedimmed in this intoxicated twilight! Ah, whose foot has not faltered and forgotten in victory- how to stand!-</p>
<p>-That I may one day be ready and ripe in the great noon-tide: ready and ripe like the glowing ore, the lightning-bearing cloud, and the swelling milk-udder:-</p>
<p>-Ready for myself and for my most hidden Will: a bow eager for its arrow, an arrow eager for its star:-</p>
<p>-A star, ready and ripe in its noontide, glowing, pierced, blessed, by annihilating sun-arrows:-</p>
<p>-A sun itself, and an inexorable sun-will, ready for annihilation in victory!</p>
<p>O Will, you change of every need, my needfulness! Spare me for one great victory!-</p>
<p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>
